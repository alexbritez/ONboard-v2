          COLUMBUS, Ohio—The broadcasting students at Upper Arlington High School have held raffles for a parking spot and concert tickets this fall to help cover costs for their spring trip to New York.
		</p>
		<p>
			What they haven't been able to do is rely on what used to be a mainstay—selling baked goods.
		</p>
		<p>
			Under new federal and state laws, schools must meet nutritional guidelines for all food sold during the day, including items in fundraisers. That means no more bake sales or candy sales during school hours. . . .
		</p>
		<p>
			Student and parent groups can sell baked goods before or after school, during athletic events and on parents' nights.
		</p>

      <text>
        <![CDATA[
		<p>
			<strong>By ANNIE MURPHY PAUL</strong>
		</p>
        <p>
          . . . Do American students have too much homework or too little? Neither, I'd say. We ought to be asking a different question altogether. What should matter to parents and educators is this: How effectively do children's after-school assignments advance learning?
		</p>
		<p>
			The quantity of students' homework is a lot less important than its quality. And evidence suggests that as of now, homework isn't making the grade. Although surveys show that the amount of time our children spend on homework has risen over the last three decades, American students are mired in the middle of international academic rankings: 17th in reading, 23rd in science and 31st in math, according to results from the Program for International Student Assessment released last December. . . .
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>Annie Murphy Paul is the author of </em>Origins<em> and is at work on a new book about the science of learning.</em>

        <![CDATA[
		<p>
			I respond to the Los Angeles Times article &quot;Can we save big bucks by ditching $ bills?&quot; As the owner of a local small business, I can only imagine the cost of doing away with dollar bills to businesses like mine. To say this is an unwise move in our uncertain economy is an understatement.
		</p>
        <p>
          Should government savings come by increasing the cost to do business? Dollar coins have been in circulation for years. As someone who handles small bills and change every day, I know that people simply do not use or want these coins.
		</p>
		<p>
			Coupled with the costs to upgrade equipment in our store, replacing the dollar bill for a coin would be a nightmare. Businesses simply should not pay the price of our government seeking cost savings.
		</p>
		<p>
			This expensive, unwanted and unnecessary change should not be one of our nation's priorities.

That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.</p>

        <![CDATA[
		<p>
			<em>By Stephen E. Lucas</em>
		</p>
        <p>
          The introduction [to the Declaration of Independence] consists of the first paragraph—a single, lengthy, periodic sentence.
        </p>
		<p>
          Taken out of context, this sentence is so general it could be used as the introduction to a declaration by any &quot;oppressed&quot; people. Seen within its original context, however, it is a model of subtlety, nuance, and implication that works on several levels of meaning and allusion [suggestion] to orient readers toward a favorable view of America and to prepare them for the rest of the Declaration. From its magisterial [commanding] opening phrase, which sets the American Revolution within the whole &quot;course of human events,&quot; to its assertion that &quot;the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God&quot; entitle America to a &quot;separate and equal station among the powers of the earth,&quot; to its quest for sanction [approval] from &quot;the opinions of mankind,&quot; the introduction elevates the quarrel with England from a petty political dispute to a major event in the grand sweep of history.
