		 	<p>Technology and sailing techniques finally came together in Europe in the 1400s. Both made it possible to search for a water route to the East in order to avoid the politically treacherous land route.</p>
			<p>The technology for maneuvering and navigating ships came from inventions in and around Europe, and from as far away as China. The triangular lateen sail, which can convert side winds to forward winds, allowed a ship to sail against the wind. This sail was brought to Europe from Arabs in Southwest Asia. The Dutch made innovations to the stern rudder, a steering device that allowed ships to be even more maneuverable. At the same time, the magnetic compass from China became commonplace in Europe, making it possible to navigate long ocean voyages.</p>

					<p>For much of the 20th century, Maya experts followed the lead of archaeologist J. Eric Thompson, who argued that the Maya were peaceful philosophers and extraordinary observers of heavenly events who were content to ponder the nature of time and the stars. This view held until at least 1976, because archaeologists did not know how to read the Maya language.</p>

		 	<p>As experts translated more glyphs [carvings], they learned that Tikal had lost a war with Caracol, a Maya city in what is today the country of Belize. The evidence is a boast of the victory, in 562 C.E., inscribed on an altar found in Caracol.</p>
			<p>Tikal recovered in 672, however, and launched a war against Dos Pilas. In the war, Tikal was triumphant. Glyph-covered stone stairways at Dos Pilas record the city's defeat.</p>
			<p>Because Teotihuac&aacute;n lies 630 miles from Tikal, many scholars originally doubted that the two empires were even aware of each other's existence. A series of fourth-century glyphic texts from Tikal helped connect the two empires, however.</p>

				 <text><![CDATA[
					<p>With reference to the speeches in this history, some were delivered before the war began, others while it was going on; some I heard myself, others I got from various quarters; it was in all cases difficult to carry them word for word in one's memory, so my habit has been to make the speakers say what was in my opinion demanded of them by the various occasions, of course adhering as closely as possible to the general sense of what they really said. And with reference to the narrative of events, far from permitting myself to derive it from the first source that came to hand, I did not even trust my own impressions, but it rests partly on what I saw myself, partly on what others saw for me, the accuracy of the report being always tried by the most severe and detailed tests possible. My conclusions have cost me some labour from the want of coincidence between accounts of the same occurrences by different eye-witnesses, arising sometimes from imperfect memory, sometimes from undue partiality for one side or the other.</p>
