Society as a whole shared assumptions about religious beliefs, about the appropriate way to integrate faith with the heritage of the ancient world, about the purposes of scholarship, and about the forms of literature and art. These shared assumptions have led historians to describe the outlook of the age as “the medieval synthesis.” But such moments of apparent stability rarely last long. Within a few generations, profound doubts had arisen on such fundamental questions as the nature of religious faith, the authority of the Church, the aims of scholarship, the source of moral ideals, and the standards of beauty in the arts. As challenges to old ideas arose, especially in the worlds of religion and cultural expression, there was an outpouring of creativity: a “golden age” comparable to those which, five hundred years earlier, had transformed the cultures of China and the Tang Dynasty or the Muslim world under the Abbassids. Like those flowerings, it has dazzled us ever since. Because those seeking new answers in Europe tended to look for guidance to what they considered to be a better past—in this case classical antiquity or the early days of Christianity—and sought to revive long-lost values, their efforts, and the times in which they lived, have been called an age of rebirth, or Renaissance.<br /><br />… The movement that [Petrarch] launched, Humanism, transformed education and the arts, but others were determined to bring change to Europe’s spiritual leadership as well.<br /><br /><font size ="14">From THE WESTERN EXPERIENCE, 10th edition, by Mortimer Chambers et al., copyright © 2010 The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.<font/>]]></mainText>
