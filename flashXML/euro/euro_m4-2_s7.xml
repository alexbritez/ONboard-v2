		<mainText><![CDATA[<p>In the fourteenth century, plague, famine, and recurring wars decimated populations and snuffed out former prosperity. At the same time, monarchies as well as the papacy struggled against mounting institutional chaos. But despite all the signs of crisis, the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries were not merely an age of breakdown. The failures of the medieval economy and its governments drove the Western peoples to repair their institutions. By the late fifteenth century the outlines of new equilibrium were emerging. In 1500 Europeans were fewer in number than they had been in 1300, but they had developed a more productive economy and a more powerful technology than they had possessed two hundred years before. These achievements were to equip them for their great expansion throughout the world in the early modern period. People living at the time tended to think in terms of the Biblical passage in Revelation referring to the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse—famine, disease, war, and the white horse of salvation. <br/><br/><font size='8'>From THE WESTERN EXPERIENCE, 10th edition, by Mortimer Chambers et al., copyright © 2010 The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.</font></p>]]></mainText>
