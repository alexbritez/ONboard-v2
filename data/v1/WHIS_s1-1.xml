				<h1>Mongols &amp; Merchants</h1>
				<p>During the 1340s, Mongols, merchants, and other travelers spread the disease known as bubonic plague along trade routes from China to Black Sea ports. Some historians believe that 20 million Chinese died from the deadly bacteria carried by fleas.</p>

				<h1>Black Death</h1>
				<p>Italian merchant ships carrying flea-infested rats brought the bubonic plague from Black Sea ports to Europe. There, the disease became known as the Black Death because victims developed black lumps before dying. Roughly 25 percent of Europeans died from the disease as it swept through crowded cities and into villages.</p>

				<h1>Explorers &amp; Smallpox</h1>
				<p>Explorers to the Americas and Pacific Islands introduced smallpox and other diseases to native peoples. Between 1500 and 1800, some 100 million people may have died during epidemics in these regions.</p>

         <text><![CDATA[
		 	<p>Alexander the Great &quot;had great personal beauty, invincible power of endurance, and a keen intellect; he was brave and adventurous, strict in the observance of his religious duties, and hungry for fame. . . .  Noble indeed was his power of inspiring his men, of filling them with confidence, and, in the moment of danger, of sweeping away their fear by the spectacle of his own fearlessness. . . . </p>
			<p>Doubtless, in the passion of the moment Alexander sometimes erred; it is true that he took some steps toward the pomp and arrogance of the Asiatic kings: but I, at least, cannot feel that such errors were very heinous, if the circumstances are taken fairly into consideration. For, after all, he was young . . . [and he was] sorry for his mistakes. . . .&quot; </p>
