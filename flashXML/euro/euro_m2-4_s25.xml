			<Text><![CDATA[<p>World War I: Trench Warfare<br /><br />     After the first month, it became clear that new military technology and mass transport had changed the manner in which war would be conducted, with terrifying results. The Eastern Front experienced the traditional warfare of mobile armies and shifting battlefields, but the great armies on the Western Front soon found themselves bogged down in siege conditions. Transport by trains allowed for a nearly endless supply of soldiers and material to a front in which new machine guns, mass shelling by artillery, and fields of barbed wire made advance practically impossible. Both sides dug trenches stretching thousands of miles across France, dotted with concrete huts called pillboxes and lined with communication cables. From these trenches, the Allied armies repeatedly mounted offensives, only to be stopped when German reinforcements arrived. <br /><br /><font size='10'>From THE WESTERN EXPERIENCE, 10th edition, by Mortimer Chambers et al., copyright © 2010 The McGraw-Hill companies, Inc.</font></p>]]></Text>
