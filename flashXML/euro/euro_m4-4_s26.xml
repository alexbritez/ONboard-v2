		<mainText><![CDATA[Background: <font face='lc-Italic'>In England two blows to monarchical power proved to be turning points. The first was the civil war and the execution of Charles I in the 1640s. But although this was a victory for Parliament, the Cromwellian period that followed and the return from exile of Charles II (eldest son of Charles I) in 1660 cast doubt on the permanence of Parliament’s victory. The second was the “Glorious Revolution” of 1688, which removed the Catholic James II (second son of Charles I) from power without the turmoil of the first revolution. As a condition of taking the throne, the new monarch’s William III (of the Netherlands) and Mary II (the Protestant daughter of James II) agreed to accept and support the English Bill of Rights.</font>
Whereas the late King James the Second, by the assistance of divers evil counsellors, judges and ministers employed by him, did endeavour to subvert and extirpate the Protestant religion and the laws and liberties of this kingdom; 
By assuming and exercising a power of dispensing with and suspending of laws and the execution of laws without consent of Parliament; 
By levying money for and to the use of the Crown by pretence of prerogative for other time and in other manner than the same was granted by Parliament; 
By raising and keeping a standing army within this kingdom in time of peace without consent of Parliament, and quartering soldiers contrary to law; 
By causing several good subjects being Protestants to be disarmed at the same time when papists were both armed and employed contrary to law; 
By violating the freedom of election of members to serve in Parliament; 
And excessive bail hath been required of persons committed in criminal cases to elude the benefit of the laws made for the liberty of the subjects; 
And excessive fines have been imposed; 
And illegal and cruel punishments inflicted; 
And several grants and promises made of fines and forfeitures before any conviction or judgment against the persons upon whom the same were to be levied; 
All which are utterly and directly contrary to the known laws and statutes and freedom of this realm; 

. . . And thereupon the said Lords Spiritual and Temporal and Commons, pursuant to their respective letters and elections, being now assembled in a full and free representative of this nation, taking into their most serious consideration the best means for attaining the ends aforesaid, do in the first place (as their ancestors in like case have usually done) for the vindicating and asserting their ancient rights and liberties declare 
That the pretended power of suspending the laws or the execution of laws by regal authority without consent of Parliament is illegal; 
That the pretended power of dispensing with laws or the execution of laws by regal authority, as it hath been assumed and exercised of late, is illegal; 
That the commission for erecting the late Court of Commissioners for Ecclesiastical Causes, and all other commissions and courts of like nature, are illegal and pernicious; 
That levying money for or to the use of the Crown by pretence of prerogative, without grant of Parliament, for longer time, or in other manner than the same is or shall be granted, is illegal; 
That it is the right of the subjects to petition the king, and all commitments and prosecutions for such petitioning are illegal; 
That the raising or keeping a standing army within the kingdom in time of peace, unless it be with consent of Parliament, is against law; 
That the subjects which are Protestants may have arms for their defence suitable to their conditions and as allowed by law; 
That election of members of Parliament ought to be free; 
That the freedom of speech and debates or proceedings in Parliament ought not to be impeached or questioned in any court or place out of Parliament; 
That excessive bail ought not to be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted; 
That jurors ought to be duly impanelled and returned, and jurors which pass upon men in trials for high treason ought to be freeholders; 
That all grants and promises of fines and forfeitures of particular persons before conviction are illegal and void; 
And that for redress of all grievances, and for the amending, strengthening and preserving of the laws, Parliaments ought to be held frequently.
