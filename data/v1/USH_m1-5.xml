         <text><![CDATA[
		 	<p>It is sometimes difficult for today's Americans to understand why the suffrage issue could have become the source of such enormous controversy. But at the time, suffrage seemed to many of its critics a very radical demand, in part because of the rationale some of its early supporters used to advance it. Throughout the late nineteenth century, many suffrage advocates presented their view in terms of "natural rights," arguing that women deserved the same rights as men – including, first and foremost, the right to vote. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, for example, wrote in 1892 of woman as &quot;the arbiter of her own destiny . . . if we are to consider her as a citizen, as a member of a great nation, she must have the same rights as all other members.&quot; This was an argument that boldly challenged the views of many men and women who believed that society required a distinctive female &quot;sphere&quot; in which women would serve first and foremost as wives and mothers. And so a powerful antisuffrage movement emerged, dominated by men but with the active support of many women. Opponents railed against the threats suffrage posed to the &quot;natural order&quot; of civilization. Antisuffragists, many of them women, associated suffrage with divorce (not without some reason, since many suffrage advocates also supported making it easier for women to obtain a divorce). They linked suffrage with promiscuity, looseness, and neglect of children.</p>
