         <text><![CDATA[<p>Of the many incidents on the road leading up to the outbreak of the Civil War, the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act and the resulting turmoil of Bloody Kansas was the most significant turning point. Before the passage of the act, sectional tensions could still be eased, but after the act, war was inevitable. The potential expansion of slavery north of the long-established Missouri Compromise line angered Northerners and even inspired the creation of the Republican Party, which sought to prevent the spread of slavery. The crossing of pro-slavery non-residents into Kansas purely to elect a pro-slavery territorial legislature fueled tensions, showing that slavery supporters were willing to break the law to maintain the institution. Finally, the rising national tensions resulting from the act—so great that two Congressmen became involved in a violent conflict on the floor of the Senate—made war inevitable.</p>]]></text>
