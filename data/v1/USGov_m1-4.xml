		  </p>
		  <p style="font-size:85%;">
		  	There are tens of thousands of local governments throughout the United States. Some of these are special-purpose governing bodies, such as school districts. Others are general-purpose governments over cities, towns, or boroughs. The general-purpose governments, called <a href="#" data-id="0" class="hotspot"><strong>municipalities,</strong></a> are the <a href="#" data-id="1" class="hotspot"><strong>grass-roots</strong></a> level of U.S. politics.
          </p>
		  <p style="font-size:85%;">
		  	There are several ways a local government can be organized, but most have a <a href="#" data-id="2" class="hotspot"><strong>mayor</strong></a> and a <a href="#" data-id="3" class="hotspot"><strong>city council</strong></a>. In some cities, the mayor or council may appoint a <a href="#" data-id="4" class="hotspot"><strong>city manager</strong></a>.
		  </p>
		  <p style="font-size:85%;">
		  	Mayors and council members are elected. Each council member typically represents a particular <a href="#" data-id="5" class="hotspot"><strong>ward</strong></a> of the city. Voters may also elect judges, school board members, and other commissioners who assist in the everyday operation of the local government.

		  	<strong>State Government</strong>
		  </p>
		  <p>
		  	State governments operate on a much broader scale than local governments. Municipalities focus on local <a href="#" data-id="0" class="hotspot"><strong>ordinances,</strong></a> whereas state legislatures pass laws that deal with issues facing larger areas.
          </p>

States are often divided into <a href="#" data-id="3" class="hotspot"><strong>districts</strong></a> that incorporate several smaller municipalities. As a result, state representatives and state senators have a broad base of <a href="#" data-id="4" class="hotspot"><strong>constituents</strong></a> to take into consideration when making laws.
		  </p>
		  <p>
		  	Governors are elected in a statewide election and serve as the chief executive of their state. Voters may also be asked to vote for <a href="#" data-id="5" class="hotspot"><strong>commissioners</strong></a> and state judges in state elections.
