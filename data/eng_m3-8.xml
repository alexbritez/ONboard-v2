Everyone has an opinion. One side insists that we must control supply, the other that we must reduce demand. People see addiction as either a disease or as a failure of will. None of this bumper sticker analysis moves us forward. The truth is that we will make progress in dealing with drug issues only when our national discourse and our strategies are as complex and comprehensive as the problem itself.	
	A concept that has been evolving with scientific advances over the past decade is that drug addiction is a brain disease that develops over time as a result of the initial voluntary behavior of using drugs. A <font face='lc-Italic'>disease</font> is defined as the “condition of the living animal or plant body that impairs normal functioning.” Interestingly, <font face='lc-Italic'>disease</font> is also defined as a “harmful development, as in a social institution.” The consequence of this brain disease is virtually uncontrollable drug craving and use that interferes with, if not destroys, an individual's functioning in the family and in society. This medical condition demands formal treatment.</p>]]></text></content><audio>eng_m3-8_s10</audio><credits><![CDATA[(tr)C Squared Studios/Getty Images; (bkgd)Grant Faint/Photographer's Choice/Getty Images.]]></credits></scene><scene id="11" type="Fill_In_Blank"><content><header><![CDATA[<p>Which sentence should be removed or revised?</p>]]></header><text><![CDATA[]]></text><correctText><![CDATA[<p><font face='c-Bold'>Revise or Remove?</font></p>

With his cheerful wave and jutting jaw, he projected an aura of physical vitality and movie-star good looks. Yet at 69 he was the oldest person to become president, and no one since Calvin Coolidge slept as soundly or as often. 
	Such serenity marked Reagan’s refusal to become bogged down in the details of his job. Outsiders applauded his “hands-off” style after four years under President Jimmy Carter, whose obsession with policy details led critics to say he missed the forest for the trees. Reagan set the direction of his administration, leaving the rest to his advisors. Sometimes that left him in the dark about major programs. Donald Regan, his first Treasury Secretary, once noted: “The Presidential mind was not cluttered with facts.”
	The effectiveness of Reagan’s message was no accident. The president had honed his public speaking skills as an actor, as a spokesperson for General Electric, and as a politician. His communications staff planned everything from the president’s words to a speech’s location and camera angles down to the lighting. But the elaborate preparation also depended on Reagan’s discipline as a performer. The president as well as his staff understood how to use a battlefield, a classroom, or the flag to communicate a hopeful message.</p>]]></text></content><audio>eng_m3-8_s16</audio><credits><![CDATA[(tr)C Squared Studios/Getty Images; (bkgd)Grant Faint/Photographer's Choice/Getty Images.]]></credits></scene><scene id="17" type="2_Txt_Img_Animation"><video>eng_m3-8_s17</video><credits><![CDATA[(tr bc)C Squared Studios/Getty Images; (br)Don Farrall/Digital Vision/Getty Images; (bkgd)Grant Faint/Photographer's Choice/Getty Images.]]></credits></scene><scene id="18" type="Activity_Multiple_Choice"><instruction>instructions go here</instruction><multiple_choice><multiple><question><![CDATA[Which sentence shows parallel structure?]]></question><answers><answer>My job includes checking the inventory, initialing the orders, and to call the suppliers.</answer><answer>The game-show contestant was told to be cheerful, charming, and with enthusiasm.</answer><answer>Grandmother likes to read mystery novels, to do needlepoint, and surfing the Internet.</answer><answer>We painted the trim in the living room; the wallpaper was put up by a professional.</answer><answer correct="true">Many people share the same three intense fears: being in high places, working with numbers, and giving speeches.</answer><figure/></answers><feedbackAudio/></multiple></multiple_choice><audio>eng_m3-8_s18</audio><credits><![CDATA[(tr)C Squared Studios/Getty Images; (bkgd)Grant Faint/Photographer's Choice/Getty Images.]]></credits></scene><scene id="19" type="Fill_In_Blank"><content><header><![CDATA[<p>Revise this sentence to be parallel, or balanced.</p>]]></header><text><![CDATA[]]></text><correctText><![CDATA[<p><font face='c-Bold'>Correct answer:</font></p>
