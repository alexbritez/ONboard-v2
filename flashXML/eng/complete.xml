<p>On the occasion corresponding to this four years ago all thoughts were anxiously directed to an impending civil war. All dreaded it, all sought to avert it.

Both parties deprecated war, but one of them would make war rather than let the nation survive, and thother would accept war rather than let it perish, and the war came.</p>

<p>One-eighth of the whole population were colored slaves, not distributed generally over the Union, but localized in the southern part of it. These slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest. All knew that this interest was somehow the cause of the war. To strengthen, perpetuate, and extend this interest was the object for which the insurgents would rend the Union even by war, while the Government claimed no right to do more than to restrict the territorial enlargement of it. Neither party expected for the war the magnitude or the duration which it has already attained.

Both read the same Bible and pray to the same God, and each invokes His aid against the other.</p>
		
<p>It may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just God’s assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other men’s faces, but let us judge not, that we be not judged. The prayers of both could not be answered. That of neither has been answered fully. The Almighty has His own purposes. “Woe unto the world because of offenses; for it must needs be that offenses come, but woe to that man by whom the offense cometh.”</p>

<p>If we shall suppose that American slavery is one of those offenses which, in the providence of God, must needs come, but which, having continued through His appointed time, He now wills to remove, and that He gives to both North and South this terrible war as the woe due to those by whom the offense came, shall we discern therein any departure from those divine attributes which the believers in a living God always ascribe to Him? Fondly do we hope, fervently do we pray, that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondsman’s two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so still it must be said “the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.”</p>

<p>With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation’s wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.</p>

The United States was at peace with that nation and, at the solicitation of Japan, was still in conversation with its government and its emperor looking toward the maintenance of peace in the Pacific.
Indeed, one hour after Japanese air squadrons had commenced bombing in the American island of Oahu, the Japanese ambassador to the United States and his colleague delivered to our Secretary of State a formal reply to a recent American message. And while this reply stated that it seemed useless to continue the existing diplomatic negotiations, it contained no threat or hint of war or of armed attack.
It will be recorded that the distance of Hawaii from Japan makes it obvious that the attack was deliberately planned many days or even weeks ago. During the intervening time, the Japanese government has deliberately sought to deceive the United States by false statements and expressions of hope for continued peace.
The attack yesterday on the Hawaiian islands has caused severe damage to American naval and military forces. I regret to tell you that very many American lives have been lost. In addition, American ships have been reported torpedoed on the high seas between San Francisco and Honolulu.
Yesterday, the Japanese government also launched an attack against Malaya.
Last night, Japanese forces attacked Hong Kong.
Last night, Japanese forces attacked Guam.
Last night, Japanese forces attacked the Philippine Islands.
Last night, the Japanese attacked Wake Island.
And this morning, the Japanese attacked Midway Island.
Japan has, therefore, undertaken a surprise offensive extending throughout the Pacific area. The facts of yesterday and today speak for themselves. The people of the United States have already formed their opinions and well understand the implications to the very life and safety of our nation.
As commander in chief of the Army and Navy, I have directed that all measures be taken for our defense. But always will our whole nation remember the character of the onslaught against us.
No matter how long it may take us to overcome this premeditated invasion, the American people in their righteous might will win through to absolute victory.
I believe that I interpret the will of the Congress and of the people when I assert that we will not only defend ourselves to the uttermost, but will make it very certain that this form of treachery shall never again endanger us.
Hostilities exist. There is no blinking at the fact that our people, our territory, and our interests are in grave danger.
With confidence in our armed forces, with the unbounding determination of our people, we will gain the inevitable triumph—so help us God.
I ask that the Congress declare that since the unprovoked and dastardly attack by Japan on Sunday, December 7th, 1941, a state of war has existed between the United States and the Japanese empire.

For I have sworn before you and Almighty God the same solemn oath our forebears prescribed nearly a century and three-quarters ago.
The world is very different now. For man holds in his mortal hands the power to abolish all forms of human poverty and all forms of human life. And yet the same revolutionary beliefs for which our forebears fought are still at issue around the globe—the belief that the rights of man come not from the generosity of the state, but from the hand of God.
We dare not forget today that we are the heirs of that first revolution. Let the word go forth from this time and place, to friend and foe alike, that the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans—born in this century, tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace, proud of our ancient heritage, and unwilling to witness or permit the slow undoing of those human rights to which this nation has always been committed, and to which we are committed today at home and around the world.]]></text></content><audio>eng_m1-3_s17</audio><credits><![CDATA[(tr)C Squared Studios/Getty Images;

Board of Education,</font> 1954</p>]]></header><text><![CDATA[Today, education is perhaps the most important function of state and local governments. Compulsory school attendance laws and the great expenditures for education both demonstrate our recognition of the importance of education to our democratic society. It is required in the performance of our most basic public responsibilities, even service in the armed forces. It is the very foundation of good citizenship. Today it is a principal instrument in awakening the child to cultural values, in preparing him for later professional training, and in helping him to adjust normally to his environment. In these days, it is doubtful that any child may reasonably be expected to succeed in life if he is denied the opportunity of an education. Such an opportunity, where the state has undertaken to provide it, is a right which must be made available to all on equal terms. 
We come then to the question presented: Does segregation of children in public schools solely on the basis of race, even though the physical facilities and other "tangible" factors may be equal, deprive the children of the minority group of equal educational opportunities? We believe that it does.

The sentence begins by claiming that it will define which sport is the most interesting sport to watch. However, “baseball players” are not a sport. They are <font face='lc-Bold'>participants</font> in a sport. To make the sentence logical, we simply have to remove the word “players.” 
This new sentence is completely logical: I think the most interesting sport to watch is baseball.

First, heroes admire hard work and have high expectations. Second, they understand that helping others does not diminish their own power. Third, heroes value commitment and learning. Dreaming big dreams for themselves and for those around them is the fourth step to becoming a hero. Fifth, heroes do not give up, and they do not let others give up. The sixth and final step is this: heroes face challenges or crises without pausing to think about receiving praise or a reward. Ironically, most heroes do not know that they are heroes. ]]></text></content><audio>eng_m2-3_s20</audio><credits><![CDATA[(tr)C Squared Studios/Getty Images; (bkgd)Grant Faint/Photographer's Choice/Getty Images.]]></credits></scene><scene id="21" type="2_Txt_Img_Animation"><video>eng_m2-3_s21</video><credits><![CDATA[(tr)C Squared Studios/Getty Images; (l r)©Pixtal/age Fotostock; (bkgd)Grant Faint/Photographer's      Choice/Getty Images.]]></credits></scene><scene id="22" type="2_Txt_Img_Animation"><video>eng_m2-3_s22</video><credits><![CDATA[(tr)C Squared Studios/Getty Images; (bkgd)Grant Faint/Photographer's Choice/Getty Images.]]></credits></scene><scene id="23" type="3_txt_img_reading"><content><header><![CDATA[Compare and Contrast Paragraph]]></header><text><![CDATA[Heroes often emerge in response to situations they never expected to encounter. In April 2011, tornadoes slammed Alabama, killing almost 300 people across the state. Survivors responded in one of two ways—by helping those around them, or by taking advantage of a terrible situation. The vast majority of people pitched in to help their neighbors by sharing food and gasoline and finding medical supplies for those in need. In contrast, looters also immediately emerged, robbing local businesses in the midst of an unprecedented crisis. The common citizen was presented with an opportunity to be a hero, and the vast majority of those in Alabama proved their valor.]]></text></content><audio>eng_m2-3_s23</audio><credits><![CDATA[(tr)C Squared Studios/Getty Images; (bkgd)Grant Faint/Photographer's Choice/Getty Images.]]></credits></scene><scene id="24" type="2_Txt_Img_Animation"><video>eng_m2-3_s24</video><credits><![CDATA[(tr)C Squared Studios/Getty Images; (c)©Brand X Pictures/PunchStock; (bkgd)Grant Faint/Photographer's      Choice/Getty Images.]]></credits></scene><scene id="25" type="2_Txt_Img_Animation"><video>eng_m2-3_s25</video><credits><![CDATA[(tr bc)C Squared Studios/Getty Images; (br)Don Farrall/Digital Vision/Getty Images; (bkgd)Grant      Faint/Photographer's Choice/Getty Images.]]></credits></scene><scene id="26" type="3_txt_img_reading"><content><header><![CDATA[Cause and Effect Paragraph]]></header><text><![CDATA[Tragedy yields heroism. When the Twin Towers fell during the attack on 9/11, early preparation was the key to saving thousands of lives. Rick Rescorla, a retired Army Colonel, was serving as the director of security at Morgan Stanley at the time of the attacks. He took his job seriously and had intermittently required all staff to follow an evacuation plan he had developed. Due to his careful planning and his order for staff to immediately evacuate the building, more than 2,500 lives were saved. Rescorla died that day, but his careful planning and attention to detail made him a hero to those he saved.]]></text></content><audio>eng_m2-3_s26</audio><credits><![CDATA[(tr)C Squared Studios/Getty Images; (bkgd)Grant Faint/Photographer's Choice/Getty Images.]]></credits></scene><scene id="27" type="7_Activity_Drag_Drop"><matchingInstructions>Match the items on the left to the correct areas on the right.</matchingInstructions><matching type="dynamic" deductionFactor="2" maxAttempts="3" hasPoints="true" points="6"><matches><match id="1"><![CDATA[Explains “how” to do it]]></match><match id="3"><![CDATA[Links connect events ]]></match><match id="2"><![CDATA[Involves two topics ]]></match><match id="3"><![CDATA[Explains “why” it happened ]]></match><match id="1"><![CDATA[Step-by-step format ]]></match><match id="2"><![CDATA[Utilizes a Venn diagram ]]></match></matches><drops title="" children-styles="margin-bottom: 0.1em;"><drop correct="1" x="521.75" y="195.2"/><drop correct="1" x="521.75" y="275.45"/><drop correct="1" x="521.75" y="357.2"/><drop correct="2" x="722.55" y="195.2"/><drop correct="2" x="722.55" y="275.45"/><drop correct="2" x="722.55" y="357.2"/><drop correct="3" x="923.35" y="195.2"/><drop correct="3" x="923.35" y="275.45"/><drop correct="3" x="923.35" y="357.2"/></drops><image>eng_m2-3_s27.jpg</image></matching><instructions>When you are done, check your results by clicking 'Check Answers.'</instructions><audio>eng_m2-3_s27</audio><credits><![CDATA[(tr)C Squared Studios/Getty Images; (bkgd)Grant Faint/Photographer's Choice/Getty Images.]]></credits></scene><scene id="28" type="2_Txt_Img_Animation"><video>eng_m2-3_s28</video><credits><![CDATA[(tr)C Squared Studios/Getty Images; (c)Jill Braaten; (bkgd)Grant Faint/Photographer's Choice/Getty Images.]]></credits></scene><scene id="29" type="7_Activity_Drag_Drop"><matchingInstructions>Match the items on the left to the correct areas on the right.</matchingInstructions><matching type="dynamic" deductionFactor="2" maxAttempts="3" hasPoints="true" points="6"><matches><match id="2"><![CDATA[Educational]]></match><match id="1"><![CDATA[Executive]]></match><match id="3"><![CDATA[Sports]]></match><match id="2"><![CDATA[Social]]></match><match id="1"><![CDATA[Judicial]]></match><match id="1"><![CDATA[Legislative]]></match><match id="2"><![CDATA[Cultural]]></match><match id="3"><![CDATA[Personal]]></match><match id="3"><![CDATA[Unsung]]></match></matches><drops title="" children-styles="margin-bottom: 0.1em;"><drop correct="1" x="521.75" y="225.2"/><drop correct="1" x="521.75" y="305.45"/><drop correct="1" x="521.75" y="387.2"/><drop correct="2" x="722.55" y="225.2"/><drop correct="2" x="722.55" y="305.45"/><drop correct="2" x="722.55" y="387.2"/><drop correct="3" x="923.35" y="225.2"/><drop correct="3" x="923.35" y="305.45"/><drop correct="3" x="923.35" y="387.2"/></drops><image>eng_m2-3_s29.jpg</image></matching><instructions>When you are done, check your results by clicking 'Check Answers.'</instructions><audio>eng_m2-3_s29</audio><credits><![CDATA[(tr)C Squared Studios/Getty Images; (bkgd)Grant Faint/Photographer's Choice/Getty Images.]]></credits></scene><scene id="30" type="3_txt_img_reading"><content><header><![CDATA[Classification Paragraph]]></header><text><![CDATA[To many people, fishing is finding a “fishy-looking” spot, tossing a hooked worm into the water, and hoping that a hungry fish just happens to be nearby.

His brows furrowed doubtfully and he pulled the end of his brown mustache.<br/>      It was quiet in the officer's room of Solar Station #5—except for the soft purring of the mighty Beam Director somewhere far below.<br/>     Robot QT-1 sat immovable. The burnished plates of his body gleamed in the Luxites and the glowing red of the photoelectric cells that were his eyes, were fixed steadily upon the Earthman at the other side of the table.<br/>     Powell repressed a sudden attack of nerves. These robots possessed peculiar brains. Oh, the three Laws of Robotics held. They had to. All of U. S. Robots, from Robertson himself to the new floor-sweeper would insist on that. So QT-1 was <font face='lc-Italic'>safe</font>! And yet—the QT models were the first of their kind, and this was the first of the QTs. Mathematical squiggles on paper were not always the most comforting protection against robotic fact.<br/>     Finally, the robot spoke. His voice carried the cold timbre inseparable from a metallic diaphragm, "Do you realize the seriousness of such a statement, Powell?"<br/>     "<font face="lc-Italic">Something</font> made you, Cutie," pointed out Powell. "You admit yourself that your memory seems to spring full-grown from an absolute blankness of a week ago. I'm giving you the explanation. Donovan and I put you together from the parts shipped us."<br/>     Cutie gazed upon his long, supple fingers in an oddly human attitude of mystification, "It strikes me that there should be a more satisfactory explanation than that.

His brows furrowed doubtfully and he pulled the end of his brown mustache.<br/>      It was quiet in the officer's room of Solar Station #5—except for the soft purring of the mighty Beam Director somewhere far below.<br/>     Robot QT-1 sat immovable. The burnished plates of his body gleamed in the Luxites and the glowing red of the photoelectric cells that were his eyes, were fixed steadily upon the Earthman at the other side of the table.<br/>     Powell repressed a sudden attack of nerves. These robots possessed peculiar brains. Oh, the three Laws of Robotics held. They had to. All of U. S. Robots, from Robertson himself to the new floor-sweeper would insist on that. So QT-1 was  <font face='lc-Italic'>safe</font>! And yet—the QT models were the first of their kind, and this was the first of the QTs. Mathematical squiggles on paper were not always the most comforting protection against robotic fact.<br/>     Finally, the robot spoke. His voice carried the cold timbre inseparable from a metallic diaphragm, "Do you realize the seriousness of such a statement, Powell?"<br/>     "<font face="lc-Italic">Something</font> made you, Cutie," pointed out Powell. "You admit yourself that your memory seems to spring full-grown from an absolute blankness of a week ago. I'm giving you the explanation. Donovan and I put you together from the parts shipped us."<br/>     Cutie gazed upon his long, supple fingers in an oddly human attitude of mystification, "It strikes me that there should be a more satisfactory explanation than that. For <font face="lc-Italic">you</font> to make <font face="lc-Italic">me</font> seems improbable."

His brows furrowed doubtfully and he pulled the end of his brown mustache.<br/>      It was quiet in the officer's room of Solar Station #5—except for the soft purring of the mighty Beam Director somewhere far below.<br/>     Robot QT-1 sat immovable. The burnished plates of his body gleamed in the Luxites and the glowing red of the photoelectric cells that were his eyes, were fixed steadily upon the Earthman at the other side of the table.<br/>     Powell repressed a sudden attack of nerves. These robots possessed peculiar brains. Oh, the three Laws of Robotics held. They had to. All of U. S. Robots, from Robertson himself to the new floor-sweeper would insist on that. So QT-1 was <font face='lc-Italic'>safe!</font> And yet—the QT models were the first of their kind, and this was the first of the QTs. Mathematical squiggles on paper were not always the most comforting protection against robotic fact.<br/>     Finally, the robot spoke. His voice carried the cold timbre inseparable from a metallic diaphragm, "Do you realize the seriousness of such a statement, Powell?"<br/>     "<font face="lc-Italic">Something</font> made you, Cutie," pointed out Powell. "You admit yourself that your memory seems to spring full-grown from an absolute blankness of a week ago. I'm giving you the explanation. Donovan and I put you together from the parts shipped us."<br/>     Cutie gazed upon his long, supple fingers in an oddly human attitude of mystification, "It strikes me that there should be a more satisfactory explanation than that. For <font face="lc-Italic">you</font> to make <font face="lc-Italic">me</font> seems improbable."

     Powell is doubtful about the robot. Powell shows he is unsure when “his brows furrowed doubtfully.” The syntax of fragments and dashes shows anxiety.

     It is ironic that the robot seems to be in control of the situation. The juxtaposition of logical, sentient machine to unsure, doubtful scientist shows the irony of the machine being in control. Irony is evident when the robot chastises man for the “seriousness of such a statement” in a role reversal of parental figure. A machine questioning its creator is unexpected. Man did not plan for the “robotic fact” that it could think for itself. “For <font face='lc-Italic'>you</font> to make <font face='lc-Italic'>me</font> seems improbable.” For the machine to say this to his creator is ironic because we do not expect a machine to be condescending toward a human.

Decades before man landed on the moon and long before the establishment of the International Space Station, in an era when one of the most advanced technological achievements was the use of an airplane for aerial bombardment, Isaac Asimov was writing about space stations and humanlike robots. Asimov was not only an author and biochemist but also a futurist, predicting some amazing achievements such as housing men in outer space. Although filled with the promise of great accomplishments, Asimov poses some questions about man and the relationship with the machines he builds. The title of his book of short stories—<font face='lc-Italic'>I, Robot</font> —hints at the idea of a machine with a mind of its own. By creating an EERIE SITUATION, making the PROTAGONIST DOUBTFUL, and ending the passage with an IRONIC STATEMENT, Asimov reveals his skeptical attitude toward technology in his short story “Reason.”
		
<font face='lc-Bold'>BODY</font> 
Several details from the passage depict an eerie, uncomfortable scene. Gregory Powell and his coworker Donovan appear to be isolated, surrounded only by machines, in a space station. The setting is “quiet” with the only sounds initially coming from the “Beam Director,” an entity that must also be a machine because it is “purring . . . somewhere far below.” Powell is alone in the “officer’s room,” having a disturbing conversation with a robot. Even the description of the robot is troubling. First, it has “glowing red” eyes reminiscent of the demonic eyes in classic horror stories. Second, its “cold timbre” voice has an unnatural, disconcerting sound. Also upsetting is the robot’s behavior because it has an “oddly human attitude.” By using all of these unsettling features in his scene, Asimov cautions the reader about relying too much on technology.	 
    	
Asimov’s cautionary tone is also evident in his protagonist’s attitude towards the robot. From the beginning of the passage, Gregory Powell is unsure about the robot. This is evident when “his brows furrowed doubtfully,” and when the robot stares at him, Powell holds back “a sudden attack of nerves.” Then beginning in the fourth paragraph, Powell has an internal monologue trying to convince himself that the robot is <font face='lc-Italic'>“safe!”</font> By placing this word in italics, Asimov reveals that Powell is not really sure of the robot. This doubt is also evident in Asimov’s syntax in the monologue using fragments and dashes to show Powell’s anxiety. Furthermore, contrasting “Mathematical squiggles . . . against robot fact” exposes Powell’s, as well as Asimov’s, lack of certainty concerning this modern technology.   

Asimov’s use of irony throughout the passage further illustrates his skeptical attitude in relation to developing robots. By juxtaposing a logical, emotional machine to an unsure, doubtful scientist, Asimov shows the irony that the robot is in control of the situation. The fact that the machine questions its creator is unexpected. In addition, irony is evident when the robot chastises the man for the “seriousness of such a statement” in a role reversal of a parental figure. Moreover, man did not plan for the “robotic fact” that the machine could think for itself. Finally, for the machine to say “For <font face='lc-Italic'>you</font> to make <font face='lc-Italic'>me</font> seems improbable,” to his creator is unquestionably ironic because we do not expect a machine, even one with artificial intelligence, to be condescending toward a human. The irony in the passage is Asimov’s way of stating that man should maintain a healthy dose of skepticism before embracing machines that can argue and reason.

Decades before man landed on the moon and long before the establishment of the International Space Station, in an era when one of the most advanced technological achievements was the use of an airplane for aerial bombardment, Isaac Asimov was writing about space stations and humanlike robots. Asimov was not only an author and biochemist but also a futurist, predicting some amazing achievements such as housing men in outer space. Although filled with the promise of great accomplishments, Asimov poses some questions about man and the relationship with the machines he builds. The title of his book of short stories—<font face='lc-Italic'>I, Robot</font> —hints at the idea of a machine with a mind of its own. By creating an EERIE SITUATION, making the PROTAGONIST DOUBTFUL, and ending the passage with an IRONIC STATEMENT, Asimov reveals his skeptical attitude toward technology in his short story “Reason.”<br/><br/><font face='lc-Bold'>BODY</font><br/>          Several details from the passage depict an eerie, uncomfortable scene. Gregory Powell and his coworker Donovan appear to be isolated, surrounded only by machines, in a space station. The setting is “quiet” with the only sounds initially coming from the “Beam Director,” an entity that must also be a machine because it is “purring . . . somewhere far below.” Powell is alone in the “officer’s room,” having a disturbing conversation with a robot. Even the description of the robot is troubling. First, it has “glowing red” eyes reminiscent of the demonic eyes in classic horror stories. Second, its “cold timbre” voice has an unnatural, disconcerting sound. Also upsetting is the robot’s behavior because it has an “oddly human attitude.” By using all of these unsettling features in his scene, Asimov cautions the reader about relying too much on technology.<br/><br/>         Asimov’s cautionary tone is also evident in his protagonist’s attitude towards the robot. From the beginning of the passage, Gregory Powell is unsure about the robot. This is evident when “his brows furrowed doubtfully,” and when the robot stares at him, Powell holds back “a sudden attack of nerves.” Then beginning in the fourth paragraph, Powell has an internal monologue trying to convince himself that the robot is <font face='lc-Italic'>“safe!”</font> By placing this word in italics, Asimov reveals that Powell is not really sure of the robot. This doubt is also evident in Asimov’s syntax in the monologue using fragments and dashes to show Powell’s anxiety. Furthermore, contrasting “Mathematical squiggles . . . against robot fact” exposes Powell’s, as well as Asimov’s, lack of certainty concerning this modern technology.<br/><br/>          Asimov’s use of irony throughout the passage further illustrates his skeptical attitude in relation to developing robots. By juxtaposing a logical, emotional machine to an unsure, doubtful scientist, Asimov shows the irony that the robot is in control of the situation. The fact that the machine questions its creator is unexpected. In addition, irony is evident when the robot chastises the man for the “seriousness of such a statement” in a role reversal of a parental figure. Moreover, man did not plan for the “robotic fact” that the machine could think for itself. Finally, for the machine to say “For <font face='lc-Italic'>you</font> to make <font face='lc-Italic'>me</font> seems improbable,” to his creator is unquestionably ironic because we do not expect a machine, even one with artificial intelligence, to be condescending toward a human. The irony in the passage is Asimov’s way of stating that man should maintain a healthy dose of skepticism before embracing machines that can argue and reason.<br/><br/><font face='lc-Bold'>CONCLUSION</font>

The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.
	He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.
	He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.
	He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.
	He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.
	He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.
	He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.
	He has endeavored to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.
	He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.
	He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.
	He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people, and eat out their substance.
	He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.
	He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.
	He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:
For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:
For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:
For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:
For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:
For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by jury:
For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences:
For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighboring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:
For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:
For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.
	He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.
	He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.
	He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to complete the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & Perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.
	He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.
	He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.

Let’s Dance!]]></header><text><![CDATA[<font face='c-Bold'>Introduction Draft</font><br/>	If you take any English class, you will be asked to write an argument or persuasive essay. This task asks that you choose a controversial topic, take a position or give an informed opinion on the issue, and then convince your audience or reader that you have a valid opinion. Traditionally, students learn that an argument is war. Applying this metaphor, they see anyone who does not agree with their point as an <font face='lc-Italic'>enemy</font>. They <font face='lc-Italic'>challenge</font> and <font face='lc-Italic'>attack</font> the opponent’s claims while <font face='lc-Italic'>aggressively</font> defending their own. Next, they <font face='lc-Italic'>target the indefensible</font> weak points, and then they <font face='lc-Italic'>counterattack</font> and <font face='lc-Italic'>shoot down</font> those claims in order to <font face='lc-Italic'>maim</font> or <font face='lc-Italic'>kill</font> the assertions made by the <font face='lc-Italic'>enemy</font>. Often, they use <font face='lc-Italic'>fighting</font> words to <font face='lc-Italic'>defend</font> their position on the topic so that by the end of the essay, the audience is left with the memory of a <font face='lc-Italic'>vicious</font> verbal <font face='lc-Italic'>battle</font>. Please, stop the nonsense! Let us be more civilized. The best argument essays are like a dance in which the writer takes the lead and guides the audience to see his position as a valid one.]]></text></content><audio>eng_m3-6_s42</audio><credits><![CDATA[(tr)C Squared Studios/Getty Images; (bkgd)Grant Faint/Photographer's Choice/Getty Images.]]></credits></scene><scene id="43" type="3_txt_img_reading"><content><header><![CDATA[]]></header><text><![CDATA[<font face='c-Bold'>Body Draft</font><br/>	First, the writer sets the stage for the performance. He must understand the controversial topic and be enthusiastic about discussing his viewpoints just as a dancer must know and be eager to use a musical selection. In preparation, both the writer and the dancer must consider who is in the audience and how the audience feels about the selected topic. The writer needs to identify the situation or issue and present the controversial points clearly. Then, if the writer has any technical or special vocabulary pertaining to the topic, he needs to define these key terms. The dancer, in similar fashion, identifies major points and defines special vocabulary in the Playbill, or the performance booklet that the audience receives upon entering the theater. Also, both the writer and the dancer must establish parameters, the boundaries or limitations of their delivery. Finally, they need to take the lead and clearly establish their position to let the audience know where they stand on the stage for this topic or selection.<br/>	After they have set the stage, the writer and the dancer are ready to start the show by taking a position and engaging the audience. An important factor with any performance is to know the audience and to understand how best to interact with it. According to the Greek philosopher Aristotle, a person can apply three types of appeal to connect to the public. The first, ethos, is an ethical appeal that helps the writer or the dancer to establish his credibility, either through his own credentials or through those that he uses to accompany him. In the dancer’s case, his accompaniment consists of the experts he uses for choreography, musical interpretations, and/or co-performers. In the writer’s case, he is accompanied by the sources he cites. No true performer faces the audience in isolation. <br/>	A second type of appeal, logos, is the logical appeal in which the writer states his evidence by citing facts, presenting statistics, or using logic and reason. This logical appeal may seem unnecessary for a dancer, but the dancer also must maintain a logical sense of rhythm and patterns. One must remember that music is a mathematical and therefore logical equation. Depending on the topic or selection, the writer and dancer want to choose carefully how to use these appeals in engaging their audience.<br/>	Pathos, the third way to engage the public, is an appeal to the emotions of the audience. The writer presents specific anecdotes and evidence to produce a desired feeling and reaction toward his position on the topic. Likewise, the dancer evokes a specific emotion through his facial expressions and body movements.<br/>	For the body paragraphs or the main section of the performance, the writer needs to gather and evaluate evidence. In the dance metaphor, this is the time to choose the choreography. In any routine or presentation, the dancer can Cha-Cha-Cha as well as Two-Step for a more interesting, fresh performance. Like the dancer, the writer must carefully choose his choreography by skillfully gathering and evaluating his evidence. Therefore, the writer must consider the steps that he will take in pulling evidence to give support to his main point or assertion. First, he can <font face='lc-Italic'>Hip-Hop</font> with current events, or check the news for any event that could support his assertion. Second, in searching for evidence, he can <font face='lc-Italic'>Fox Trot</font> with history, or use his interdisciplinary connection and recall what he learned in social studies classes. A third way to find evidence is to make a connection to something in literature and <font face='lc-Italic'>Waltz</font> with a literary theme. Finally, he can count on his own experience for evidence to support his assertion, and <font face='lc-Italic'>Swing</font> with a personal anecdote.<br/>	In evaluating evidence, the writer, like the dancer, must assess the effectiveness of his routine. First, the information must be relevant to his main point. Second, the evidence must represent a variety of sources rather than just one or two. Third, the evidence should be sufficient to leave the audience satisfied. Furthermore, he should be careful not to take any missteps, such as presenting vague or false information. These missteps or logical fallacies would make him lose credibility with his public. <br/>	Just as a dancer would bow to acknowledge his competitor, the writer should give credit to the best points of the opposing argument. That is, he should concede valid points on the other side. However, he should also be prepared to surpass those points with his rebuttal. This is similar to the dancer’s attitude saying, “You’re good, but watch me outperform you.” Snap!<br/>	Lastly is the grand finale. Comparatively, the writer and the dancer will remind the audience of how important this performance has been. They will leave their public applauding for an encore. And long after they have left the stage, the audience will recall and be influenced by the echo of the dance steps.]]></text></content><audio>eng_m3-6_s43</audio><credits><![CDATA[(tr)C Squared Studios/Getty Images; (bkgd)Grant Faint/Photographer's Choice/Getty Images.]]></credits></scene><scene id="44" type="3_txt_img_reading"><content><header><![CDATA[]]></header><text><![CDATA[<font face='c-Bold'>Conclusion Draft</font><br/>	To watch politicians bicker, one can see that the debate currently belongs to a culture of war. Debaters confront their rival, strike, and retaliate as they shoot down each other’s claims with the intent to cripple or destroy their opponent’s assertions. However, a carefully choreographed <font face='lc-Italic'>Two-Step</font>, <font face='lc-Italic'>Twist</font>, or <font face='lc-Italic'>Tango</font> can just as easily and more gracefully persuade an audience through a show of facts and examples.

<br/>War seems to be an inevitable part of the human experience. Depending on the circumstances, war is considered ennobling, necessary, and just. However, it may also be seen as corrupt, irrational, or even evil. Must war be an unavoidable part of human civilization? Is the sacrifice of war worth it? Do the casualties outweigh the causes? 
<br/>Read the following sources (including any introductory information) carefully. Then develop a position about what issues should be considered most important in making the decision to declare war.
<br/>Make sure that your argument is central; use the sources to illustrate and support your reasoning. Avoid merely summarizing the sources. Indicate clearly which sources you are drawing from, whether through direct quotation, paraphrase, or summary. You may cite the sources as Source A, Source B, etc., or by using the descriptions in parentheses.

As time progresses, society must re-evaluate this treatment in order to ensure that each citizen has an opportunity to achieve fulfillment. The United States struggles with this evaluation of identity in the realm of women’s rights. Since the country’s inception, the U.S. has dealt with victories and failures as its leaders and citizenry seek to establish just treatment for all members of the society. The success or failure of the fair and equal treatment of women in the United States will determine the society’s ultimate identity.
	The journey of the United States toward just treatment of all citizens must encompass an understanding of the history of inequality in order to appreciate the larger context of the struggle and move toward meaningful and relevant change. The struggle for women’s rights is not a new struggle; for centuries, women have understood that their identity within society was tenuous at best. Elizabeth Jones, in her address to a women’s rights convention in 1850, tackles the issue of equality by demanding that women be recognized as “equal members of the human family” (A). Jones’s views in 1850, while vehemently stated, were not extreme for her time period. In fact, almost a century earlier, Mary Wollstonecraft extols similar sentiments in <font face='lc-Italic'>Vindication of the Rights of Women</font>, exclaiming that “women must be allowed to found their virtue of knowledge . . . educated by the same pursuits as men” (B). Obviously, the issue of women’s rights is not restricted merely to the distant past and is, in fact, a fight taking place across the country’s history. Most recently, women endure wages far below their male counterparts (E). Through evaluating the role of this issue in the country’s larger cultural development, we can appreciate the greater need for real and lasting change as a way to provide fulfillment for all citizens.

Everyone has an opinion. One side insists that we must control supply, the other that we must reduce demand. People see addiction as either a disease or as a failure of will. None of this bumper sticker analysis moves us forward. The truth is that we will make progress in dealing with drug issues only when our national discourse and our strategies are as complex and comprehensive as the problem itself.	
	A concept that has been evolving with scientific advances over the past decade is that drug addiction is a brain disease that develops over time as a result of the initial voluntary behavior of using drugs. A <font face='lc-Italic'>disease</font> is defined as the “condition of the living animal or plant body that impairs normal functioning.” Interestingly, <font face='lc-Italic'>disease</font> is also defined as a “harmful development, as in a social institution.” The consequence of this brain disease is virtually uncontrollable drug craving and use that interferes with, if not destroys, an individual's functioning in the family and in society.

With his cheerful wave and jutting jaw, he projected an aura of physical vitality and movie-star good looks. Yet at 69 he was the oldest person to become president, and no one since Calvin Coolidge slept as soundly or as often. 
	Such serenity marked Reagan’s refusal to become bogged down in the details of his job. Outsiders applauded his “hands-off” style after four years under President Jimmy Carter, whose obsession with policy details led critics to say he missed the forest for the trees. Reagan set the direction of his administration, leaving the rest to his advisors. Sometimes that left him in the dark about major programs. Donald Regan, his first Treasury Secretary, once noted: “The Presidential mind was not cluttered with facts.”
	The effectiveness of Reagan’s message was no accident. The president had honed his public speaking skills as an actor, as a spokesperson for General Electric, and as a politician. His communications staff planned everything from the president’s words to a speech’s location and camera angles down to the lighting. But the elaborate preparation also depended on Reagan’s discipline as a performer. The president as well as his staff understood how to use a battlefield, a classroom, or the flag to communicate a hopeful message.</p>]]></text></content><audio>eng_m3-8_s16</audio><credits><![CDATA[(tr)C Squared Studios/Getty Images; (bkgd)Grant Faint/Photographer's Choice/Getty Images.]]></credits></scene><scene id="17" type="2_Txt_Img_Animation"><video>eng_m3-8_s17</video><credits><![CDATA[(tr bc)C Squared Studios/Getty Images; (br)Don Farrall/Digital Vision/Getty Images; (bkgd)Grant Faint/Photographer's Choice/Getty Images.]]></credits></scene><scene id="18" type="Activity_Multiple_Choice"><instruction>instructions go here</instruction><multiple_choice><multiple><question><![CDATA[Which sentence shows parallel structure?]]></question><answers><answer>My job includes checking the inventory, initialing the orders, and to call the suppliers.</answer><answer>The game-show contestant was told to be cheerful, charming, and with enthusiasm.</answer><answer>Grandmother likes to read mystery novels, to do needlepoint, and surfing the Internet.</answer><answer>We painted the trim in the living room; the wallpaper was put up by a professional.</answer><answer correct="true">Many people share the same three intense fears: being in high places, working with numbers, and giving speeches.</answer><figure/></answers><feedbackAudio/></multiple></multiple_choice><audio>eng_m3-8_s18</audio><credits><![CDATA[(tr)C Squared Studios/Getty Images; (bkgd)Grant Faint/Photographer's Choice/Getty Images.]]></credits></scene><scene id="19" type="Fill_In_Blank"><content><header><![CDATA[<p>Revise this sentence to be parallel, or balanced.</p>]]></header><text><![CDATA[]]></text><correctText><![CDATA[<p><font face='c-Bold'>Correct answer:</font></p>
