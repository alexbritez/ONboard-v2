			<hotspot title="What?" dynamic="true" x="256" y="82"><![CDATA[
				<h1>What was the situation or condition that led to the event?</h1>
				<p style="font-size: 80%">At the beginning of the Civil War, the regular army of the North consisted of around 16,000 troops, many of them stationed in the West to protect white settlers from American Indians. To wage war successfully, the Union had to raise a vast army any way they could. By March 1863, Congress was forced to pass a national draft law. Virtually all young adult males were eligible to be drafted, but a man could escape service by hiring someone to go in his place or by paying the government $300.</p>
			]]></hotspot>
			<hotspot title="When?" dynamic="true" x="466" y="82"><![CDATA[
				<h1>When did the event occur?</h1>
				<p>Demonstrators against the Civil War draft rioted for four days in July 1863. The riot began on July 13, when New York City officials began drawing names for the draft.</p>
			]]></hotspot>
			<hotspot title="Why?" dynamic="true" x="6" y="202"><![CDATA[
				<h1>Why did the event occur?</h1>
				<p style="font-size: 80%">Poor laborers were angry because wealthy people could be exempted from the draft or could hire someone to fight in their place. Irish workers were hostile because African American strikebreakers had been used against them in a recent longshoremen's strike, and they blamed African Americans generally for the Civil War, which they thought was being fought for the benefit of slaves who would soon be competing with white workers in the North for jobs.</p>
			]]></hotspot>
			<hotspot title="Where?" dynamic="true" x="415" y="202"><![CDATA[
				<h1>Where did the event occur?</h1>
				<p>New York City was the site of the worst draft riots—one of the most violent urban uprisings in American history. The rioters lynched a number of African Americans, burned down homes and businesses (mostly those of free African Americans), and destroyed the orphanage shown here that housed African American children.</p>
			]]></hotspot>
			<hotspot title="Who?" dynamic="true" x="469" y="352"><![CDATA[
				<h1>Who was involved?</h1>
				<p>Four thousand men, mostly poor Irish laborers, were at the center of the violence during the draft riots. More than 100 people died—a number of them African Americans who were lynched.</p>

				<h1>The Event</h1>
				<p>Protest Against the Vietnam War Draft</p>
			]]></hotspot>
			<hotspot title="What?" dynamic="true" x="164" y="335"><![CDATA[
				<h1>What was the situation or condition that led to the event?</h1>
				<p style="font-size: 80%;">As the Vietnam War dragged on, political support for it began to erode. A series of "teach-ins" on university campuses, beginning at the University of Michigan in 1965, sparked a national debate over the war. By the end of 1967, American students opposed to the war had become a significant political force. Enormous peace marches in New York, Washington, D.C., and other cities drew broad public attention to the antiwar movement. Closely related to opposition to the war was opposition to the military draft.</p>
			]]></hotspot>
			<hotspot title="When?" dynamic="true" x="10" y="335"><![CDATA[
				<h1>When did the event occur?</h1>
				<p>This particular anti-draft protest occurred in 1968. Many similar protests took place from 1965 until the withdrawal of the United States from Vietnam in 1973.</p>
			]]></hotspot>
			<hotspot title="Why?" dynamic="true" x="318" y="335"><![CDATA[
				<h1>Why did the event occur?</h1>
				<p>Organized protests against the Vietnam War did not occur until 1965, when the military draft increased conscription from 3,000 a month to 33,000 a month. People who traditionally were able to obtain deferments—graduate students, teachers, husbands, fathers, and others—were added to the list of draftees. Many young men began burning their draft papers, and recruitment offices became targets of protesters.</p>
			]]></hotspot>
			<hotspot title="Where?" dynamic="true" x="472" y="10"><![CDATA[
				<h1>Where did the event occur?</h1>
				<p>This particular anti-draft protest occurred at the University of California at Berkeley. Many similar protests took place throughout major cities and college campuses across the nation.</p>
			]]></hotspot>
			<hotspot title="Who?" dynamic="true" x="472" y="335"><![CDATA[
				<h1>Who was involved?</h1>
				<p>Student activists in the 1960s became known as the New Left—a large, diverse group of men and women energized by the polarizing developments of their time. The New Left embraced the cause of African Americans and other minorities, drawing its inspiration from the civil rights movement.</p>

         <header italic="false">The Treaty of Greenville, 1795</header>
         <text><![CDATA[
		 	<p>A treaty of peace between the United States of America, and the tribes of Indians called the Wyandots, Delawares, Shawanees, Ottawas, Chippewas, Pattawatimas, Miamis, Eel Rivers, Weas, Kickapoos, Piankeshaws, and Kaskaskias.</p>
			<p>To put an end to a destructive war, to settle all controversies, and to restore harmony and friendly intercourse between the said United States and Indian tribes, Anthony Wayne, major general commanding the army of the United States, and sole commissioner for the good purposes above mentioned, and the said tribes of Indians, by their sachems, chiefs, and warriors, met together at Greenville, the head quarters of the said army, have agreed on the following articles, which, when ratified by the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate of the United States, shall be binding on them and the said Indian tribes.</p>
			<p><strong>Art. 1</strong>: Henceforth all hostilities shall cease; peace is hereby established, and shall be perpetual; and a friendly intercourse shall take place between the said United States and Indian tribes.</p>
			<p><strong>Art. 2</strong>: All prisoners shall, on both sides, be restored. . . .</p>
			<p><strong>Art. 3</strong>: The general boundary line between the lands of the United States and the lands of the said Indian tribes, shall begin at the mouth of Cayahoga river, and run thence up the same to the portage, between that and the Tuscarawas branch of the Muskingum, thence down that branch to the crossing place above fort Lawrence, thence westerly to a fork of that branch of the Great Miami river, running into the Ohio, at or near which fork stood Loromie's store. . . . [explicit boundary details continue for several pages]</p>
			<p><strong>Art. 4</strong>: . . . the United States relinquish their claims to all other Indian lands northward of the river Ohio, eastward of the Mississippi, and westward and southward of the Great Lakes and the waters. . . .</p>
			<p>. . . the United States now deliver to the said Indian tribes a quantity of goods to the value of twenty thousand dollars, the receipt whereof they do hereby acknowledge. . . .</p>
			<p><strong>Art. 5</strong>: To prevent any misunderstanding about the Indian lands relinquished by the United States in the fourth article, it is now explicitly declared, that the meaning of that relinquishment is this: the Indian tribes who have a right to those lands, are quietly to enjoy them, hunting, planting, and dwelling thereon, so long as they please, without any molestation from the United States; but when those tribes, or any of them, shall be disposed to sell their lands, or any part of them, they are to be sold only to the United States; and until such sale, the United States will protect all the said Indian tribes in the quiet enjoyment of their lands against all citizens of the United States, and against all other white persons who intrude upon the same. And the said Indian tribes again acknowledge themselves to be under the protection of the said United States, and no other power whatever.</p>
			<p><strong>Art. 7</strong>: The said tribes of Indians, parties to this treaty, shall be at liberty to hunt within the territory and lands which they have now ceded to the United States, without hindrance or molestation, so long as they demean themselves peaceably, and offer no injury to the people of the United States. . . . </p>
			<p><strong>Art. 8</strong>: Trade shall be opened with the said Indian tribes.</p>

					<p>Between the 1820s and the 1850s, the American economy experienced the beginnings of an industrial revolution—a change so profound that in the United States, as in Europe, it transformed almost every area of life in fundamental ways.</p>
					<p>The American industrial revolution was a result of many things: population growth (through both natural increase and immigration), advances in transportation and communication, new technologies that spurred the development of factories capable of mass producing goods, the recruiting of a large industrial labor force, and the creation of corporate bodies capable of managing large enterprises. The new economy created great wealth, expanding the ranks of the wealthy and helping to create a large new middle class. It also created high levels of inequality which were particularly visible in the growth of a large industrial working class.</p>
