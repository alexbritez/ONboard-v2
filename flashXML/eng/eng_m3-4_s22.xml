		<mainText><![CDATA[     This is an eerie scene. The “glowing red” robot’s eyes appear demonic. The “quiet” setting except for the noise of the “Beam Director” surrounds an isolated human. The Robot’s “cold timbre” voice sounds unnatural. The Robot’s “oddly human attitude” is disturbing. The disturbing conversation between man and machine occurs because the machine can reason and think for itself.
		
     Powell is doubtful about the robot. Powell shows he is unsure when “his brows furrowed doubtfully.” The syntax of fragments and dashes shows anxiety. Powell shows anxiety when he “repressed a sudden attack of nerves.” The word <font face='lc-Italic'>“safe!”</font> in italic reveals that he is not really sure of the robot but that he is only trying to convince himself. “Mathematical squiggles . . . against robot fact” exposes Powell’s lack of certainty about the machine’s capabilities.
	 
     It is ironic that the robot seems to be in control of the situation. The juxtaposition of logical, sentient machine to unsure, doubtful scientist shows the irony of the machine being in control. Irony is evident when the robot chastises man for the “seriousness of such a statement” in a role reversal of parental figure. A machine questioning its creator is unexpected. Man did not plan for the “robotic fact” that it could think for itself. “For <font face='lc-Italic'>you</font> to make <font face='lc-Italic'>me</font> seems improbable.” For the machine to say this to his creator is ironic because we do not expect a machine to be condescending toward a human.
