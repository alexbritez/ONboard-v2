			<popTitle>HOW?</popTitle>
			<popInfo>How does memory work? The human brain has an incredible ability to process and store information. But only a small amount of acquired information is retained for future use. Everything in short-term memory is erased on a daily basis. As you sleep, the sub-conscious function of the brain selectively places important pieces of information into long-term memory. Most of what was in the short-term memory from the preceding day is classified as unimportant and forgotten.</popInfo>
