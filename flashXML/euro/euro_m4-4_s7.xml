			<Text><![CDATA[ Prompt: “Analyze the impact of technology on popular entertainment in the years between 1890 and 2010.”

Sample Introduction #1<br/><br/>In the late-nineteenth century, new technologies such as moving pictures and the phonograph established the foundation for mass entertainment in Western culture. By the middle of the 20th century radio and television further revolutionized mass culture. By the dawn of the 21st century, people were able to store vast amounts of information on their iPods® and cell phones. Thus, advances in technology profoundly altered popular culture between 1890 and 2010.

Sample Introduction #2<br/><br/>The 1980s saw a revolution in technology related to mass culture. First, the advent of the personal computer enabled the average household to possess unimaginable computing power in a relatively small package. Meanwhile, the mass-production of VHS tapes enabled consumers to rent and purchase movies at their convenience, increasing the power of the consumer to see what they wanted on demand. The 1980s also saw the development of compact discs (CDs) a digital format that foreshadowed DVDs in the 1990s and iPods® in the 2000s.]]></Text>
