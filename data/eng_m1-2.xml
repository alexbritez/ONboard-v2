Since 2000, my colleagues and I have conducted several studies on bullying. For this article, I used data from students in grades 8-12 to gain an understanding of bullying among older adolescents.</p>
<p>Participants in the study included 1,893 students in grades 8-12. Ethnic breakdown of participating students was 11% African American, 22% Hispanic, and 77% Anglo. Fifty-one percent were boys and 49% girls. Twenty-two percent of the participants were in the 8th grade, 53% were in the 9th grade, 14% were in the 10th grade, 8% were in the 11th grade, and 3% were in the 12th grade.</p>
