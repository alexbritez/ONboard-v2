				<h1>Influence of Geography</h1>
				<p>One of the most earthquake-prone areas on Earth is the western part of South America, including the Andes. For this reason, Inca buildings were rarely higher than one story. Other architectural challenges included building suspension bridges across deep valleys, road systems, and stair-stepped walkways up mountainsides to help humans move from place to place within the empire.</p>

				<h1>Decorative Elements</h1>
				<p>Most Inca buildings were rectangular in shape and had few design elements. Even palaces and temples were rectangular in design. Few defensive works were constructed throughout the empire, and city walls were only ornamental because the Inca faced no significant external enemies until the Spanish conquistadors arrived.</p>
			]]></hotspot>
			<hotspot title="Building Materials" dynamic="true" x="468" y="94"><![CDATA[
				<h1>Building Materials</h1>
				<p>Timber was not often used in construction because there were few trees in the empire. Building materials were usually stone, sometimes shaped into complex polygonal shapes so finely crafted that a knife blade could not be inserted between individual stones. Adobe plastered over masonry was also used. </p>

			<hotspot title="Source of Construction Labor" dynamic="true" x="432" y="12"><![CDATA[
				<h1>Source of Construction Labor</h1>
				<p>For construction labor, Inca rulers imposed a system called <em>mita</em>, where subjects were forced into performing work part of each year on roads, suspension bridges, palaces, and huge warehouses where food, textiles, and other items were stockpiled to be distributed by Inca administrators.</p>

         <text><![CDATA[
		 	<p>Legalism, a style of governing that relies on strict laws and harsh punishments, unified and calmed China. One of the most famous theorists of Legalism was Han Feizi, who wrote that the only answer to chaos was harsh governance. The basis of an orderly society was the military and agriculture, so Legalists emphasized soldiers and peasants while de-emphasizing other classes. Men were discouraged from becoming merchants or scholars. Harsh penalties were imposed on both minor and major crimes. Entire families could be punished along with the offender.</p>
			<p>Emperor Qin Shihuangdi and other rulers used Legalism to unite China in the Qin and Han dynasties. In later dynasties, tension arose between those advocating moral behavior of Confucianism and those promoting rule of law in Legalism. Legalism was effective, but history was written by Confucianists. Thus, Legalists have been harshly criticized in the annals of Chinese history.</p>

					<p>Legalism, a style of governing that relies on strict laws and harsh punishments, unified and calmed China. One of the most famous theorists of Legalism was Han Feizi, who wrote that the only answer to chaos was harsh governance. The basis of an orderly society was the military and agriculture, so Legalists emphasized soldiers and peasants while de-emphasizing other classes. Men were discouraged from becoming merchants or scholars. Harsh penalties were imposed on both minor and major crimes. Entire families could be punished along with the offender.</p>
					<p>Emperor Qin Shihuangdi and other rulers used Legalism to unite China in the Qin and Han dynasties. In later dynasties, tension arose between those advocating moral behavior of Confucianism and those promoting rule of law in Legalism. Legalism was effective, but history was written by Confucianists. Thus, Legalists have been harshly criticized in the annals of Chinese history.</p>
