		 	<p>&quot;Dear Mimmy, [Saturday, May 2, 1992]<br/>
Today was truly, absolutely the worse day ever in Sarajevo. The shelling started around noon. Mommy and I moved into the hall. Daddy was in his office, under our apartment, at the time. We told him on the intercom to run quickly to the downstairs lobby where we'd meet him. . . . The gunfire was getting worse, and we couldn't get over the wall to the Bobars', so we ran down to our own cellar.<br/>
. . . We listened to the pounding shells, the shooting, the thundering noise overhead. . . . We heard glass shattering in our street. Horrible. I put my fingers in my ears to block out the terrible sounds. . . . At around 8:00 we went back up to our apartment. Almost every window in our street was broken. Ours were all right, thank God. I saw the post office in flames. A terrible sight. . . . The whole apartment smelled of the burning fire. . . . &quot;</p>

					<p>The Emperor Justinian was born in our time, and succeeding to the throne when the state was decayed, added greatly to its extent and glory by driving out from it the barbarians, who for so long a time had forced their way into it . . . .  He has annexed to the Roman Empire many other states which at his accession were independent and has founded innumerable cities which had no previous existence. As for religion, which he found uncertain and torn by various heresies, he destroyed everything which could lead to error, and securely established the true faith upon one solid foundation. Moreover, finding the laws obscure through their unnecessary <br/>multitude, . . . he firmly established them by reducing the number of those which were unnecessary, and in those that were contradictory, by confirming the better ones. He forgave of his own accord those who plotted against him, and by loading with wealth those who were in want, and relieving them from the misfortunes which had afflicted them, he rendered the empire stable and its members happy.</p>

         <text><![CDATA[
		 	<p>Justinian brought on the Roman disasters which surely surpassed both in gravity and in number all that had ever been heard of in any period of history. For without the slightest hesitation he used to embark on the inexcusable murdering of his fellowmen and the plundering of other people's property; and it did not matter to him how many thousands lost their lives, although they had given him no provocation whatsoever. The maintenance of established institutions meant nothing to him; endless innovations were his constant preoccupation. In a word, he was a unique destroyer of valuable institutions. . . . </p>
			<p>He seemed to be a convinced believer in Christ, but this too meant ruin for his subjects; for he allowed the priests to use violence against their neighbors almost with impunity, and when they looted the estates next to their own he wished them joy, thinking in doing so he was honoring the Almighty.</p>

		 	<p>In many ways, the world of prehistoric human beings seems remote and even alien. Yet the evolution of the human species and the development of human society during the Paleolithic and Neolithic eras have profoundly influenced the lives of all the world's peoples during the past six millennia.  Paleolithic peoples enjoyed levels of intelligence that far exceeded those of other animals, and they invented tools and languages that enabled them to flourish in all regions of the world. Indeed, they thrived so well that they threatened their sources of food. Their Neolithic descendants began to cultivate food to sustain their communities, and the agricultural societies that they built transformed the world. Human population rose dramatically, and human groups congregated in villages, towns, and eventually cities. There they engaged in specialized labor and launched industries that produced pottery, metal goods, and textiles as well as tools and decorative items. Thus intelligence, language, reflective thought, agriculture, urban settlements, and craft industries all figure in the legacy that prehistoric human beings left for their descendants.</p>
