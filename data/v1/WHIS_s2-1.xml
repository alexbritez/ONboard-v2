				<h1>Bubonic Plague</h1>
				<p>During the 1340s, Mongols, merchants, and other travelers spread the disease known as bubonic plague along trade routes from China to Black Sea ports. Some historians believe that 20 million Chinese died from the deadly bacteria carried by fleas.</p>
			]]></hotspot>
			<hotspot title="Black Death" dynamic="true" x="221" y="129"><![CDATA[
				<h1>Black Death</h1>
				<p>Italian merchant ships carrying flea-infested rats brought the bubonic plague from Black Sea ports to Europe. There, the disease became known as the Black Death because victims developed black lumps before dying. Roughly 25 percent of Europeans died from the disease as it swept through crowded cities and into villages.</p>

        <h1>Smallpox</h1>
        <p>Explorers to the Americas and Pacific Islands introduced smallpox and other diseases to native peoples. Between 1500 and 1800, some 100 million people may have died during epidemics in these regions.</p>

        <h1>HIV/AIDS</h1>
        <p style="font-size:80%">The most serious epidemic threat today comes from acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). This fatal disease is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which slowly attacks and destroys the immune system, leaving the infected individual vulnerable to diseases that eventually cause death. The AIDS epidemic is a serious threat throughout the world, but the disease has struck the developing world hardest, especially sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

      <hotspot title="Influenza" dynamic="true" x="109" y="90"><![CDATA[
        <h1>Influenza</h1>
        <p>An influenza pandemic swept the globe in 1918 and 1919. It killed between 20 and 40 million people, far more than the number who died as the result of the Great War (World War I), which had just ended.</p>

				<h1>Porcelain</h1>
				<p>During the Tang dynasty, Chinese craft workers discovered techniques of producing high-quality porcelain, which was lighter, thinner, and adaptable to more uses than earlier pottery. Tang and Song porcelain became so famous throughout Southeast Asia, India, Persia, and East Africa that it was known as chinaware.</p>
			]]></hotspot>
			<hotspot title="Metallurgy" dynamic="true" x="242" y="53"><![CDATA[
				<h1>Metallurgy</h1>
				<p>Production of stronger iron and steel surged during the Tang and Song dynasties. Most of the iron and steel went into weaponry, agricultural tools, and construction projects involving bridges and pagodas.</p>
			]]></hotspot>
			<hotspot title="Agricultural Technology" dynamic="true" x="27" y="53"><![CDATA[
				<h1>Agricultural Technology</h1>
				<p style="font-size:80%">The Song increased productivity by harnessing oxen (in the north) and water buffalo (in the south) to heavy iron plows to prepare land for cultivation. They enriched the soil with manure and composted organic matter. Extensive irrigation systems included reservoirs, dikes, dams, canals, pumps, and waterwheels powered by animals and humans. Farming on terraced mountainsides also expanded China's agricultural potential.</p>
			]]></hotspot>
			<hotspot title="Gunpowder" dynamic="true" x="450" y="53"><![CDATA[
				<h1>Gunpowder</h1>
				<p>Daoist alchemists discovered how to make gunpowder during the Tang dynasty as they sought elixirs to prolong life. Military officials recognized opportunity in the explosive mixture. They were soon using gunpowder in bamboo &quot;fire lances&quot;â€”a kind of flamethrowerâ€”and in primitive bombs.</p>
			]]></hotspot>
			<hotspot title="Printing" dynamic="true" x="27" y="310"><![CDATA[
				<h1>Printing</h1>
				<p>Printing became common during the Tang dynasty. The earliest printers employed block-printing techniques: carving a reverse image onto a wooden block, inking the block, and then pressing a sheet of paper on top. By the Song dynasty, printers had begun to experiment with reusable, movable type. Printing made it possible to produce texts quickly, cheaply, and in huge quantities.</p>
			]]></hotspot>
			<hotspot title="Naval Technology" dynamic="true" x="242" y="310"><![CDATA[
				<h1>Naval Technology</h1>
				<p>By the Song dynasty, Chinese seafarers sailed ships constructed with iron nails, waterproofed with oils, furnished with watertight bulkheads, driven by canvas and bamboo sails, steered by rudders, and navigated with the aid of the &quot;south-pointing needle&quot;â€”the magnetic compass. Larger ships sometimes had small rockets powered by gunpowder.</p>
			]]></hotspot>
			<hotspot title="Currency" dynamic="true" x="450" y="310"><![CDATA[
				<h1>Currency</h1>
				<p style="font-size:80%">Chinese merchants developed alternatives to carrying copper coins. Letters of credit became common during the early Tang dynasty. Later developments included the use of promissory notes and checks. The search for alternatives to coinage also led to the invention of paper money, which was first printed by merchants but taken over by the government in 1024. By 1100, currency was printed with serial numbers and warnings against counterfeit notes.</p>

				<h1>Political Structures</h1>
				<p>Political structures refer to the process of setting up government institutions, through which a society makes and enforces public policies such as taxation, defense, criminal laws, education, and so on. Government is made up of those people who exercise a state's powersâ€”those who have authority and control over people.</p>

				<h1>American Revolution 1</h1>
				<p style="font-size:80%">In the mid-1700s, it seemed unlikely that North America would become the center of revolution. The British colonies were economically prosperous and securely British in their tastes and habits. Yet that began to change after the French and Indian War, when Britain imposed a series of taxes and trade restrictions on the colonies. The colonists began to argue that they should govern their own affairs. Boycotts, protests, and direct conflict soon followed.</p>
			]]></hotspot>
			<hotspot dynamic="true" x="107" y="321"><![CDATA[
				<h1>American Revolution 2</h1>
				<p style="font-size:80%">The Patriots' Continental Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence. The resulting war to secure political rights lasted nearly five years, with the original British advantages in troop strength, organization, and experience eventually outweighed by the colonists' home field advantage, guerrilla tactics, and support from European powers who hoped to diminish British power. In 1787, the U.S. Constitution created a federal government based on popular sovereignty.</p>
			]]></hotspot>
			<hotspot dynamic="true" x="328" y="30"><![CDATA[
				<h1>French Revolution 1</h1>
				<p style="font-size:80%">The French Revolution drew inspiration from the American experience, but it proved much more radical in scope, time frame, and ideals. French revolutionaries wanted to replace the old order with new cultural, social, and political structures. Members of the Third Estateâ€”the common peopleâ€”formed the National Assembly in 1789 and demanded a written constitution that dismantled social distinctions.</p>
			]]></hotspot>
			<hotspot dynamic="true" x="327" y="220"><![CDATA[
				<h1>French Revolution 2</h1>
				<p style="font-size:75%">The National Assembly took power and declared war on other European nations as well as abolished its own monarchy. From 1793 to 1794, more than 40,000 "enemies at home" were guillotined by radicals in power. A new institution known as the Directory seized control but was unable to resolve France's military or political problems. General Napoleon Bonaparte overthrew the Directory, eventually crowning himself emperor. After defeating much of Europe, Napoleon lost most of his Grand Army after invading Russia. He was forced to abdicate in 1814.</p>
			]]></hotspot>
			<hotspot dynamic="true" x="429" y="30"><![CDATA[
				<h1>Latin America 1</h1>
				<p style="font-size:75%">The ideals of the Enlightenment and revolution spread to the Portuguese and Spanish colonies in the Americas. Conflicts became increasingly common between the &quot;peninsulares,&quot; or colonial officials from Portugal or Spain, and the &quot;criollos&quot; (creoles), or individuals born in the Americas of Portuguese or Spanish descent. The criollos resented the political and economic restrictions placed on them, and they sought to displace the peninsulares while retaining their own social status over indigenous peoples and enslaved Africans.</p>
			]]></hotspot>
			<hotspot dynamic="true" x="427" y="310"><![CDATA[
				<h1>Latin America 2</h1>
				<p style="font-size:80%">Sim&oacute;n BolÃ­var led a struggling movement for independence from Spanish rule beginning in 1811. By 1819, his 20,000 troops defeated the Spanish forces first in Colombia and then in Venezuela, Ecuador, and Peru. BolÃ­var coordinated efforts with JosÃ© de San MartÃ­n in Argentina and Bernardo O'Higgins in Chile. Latin American society remained intensely stratified, however, with the criollos replacing the peninsulares as the elite.</p>

			<hotspot title="Economic system" dynamic="true" x="20" y="6"><![CDATA[
				<h1>Economic system</h1>
				<p style="font-size:80%">An economic system answers these questions: WHAT goods and services should a society produce with the resources it has? HOW should those goods and services be produced? WHO should get the final goods and services? In a traditional system, habit and custom answer these questions. In a market system, the interaction of supply, demand, and prices determine the answers. In a command system, government leaders control the use and distribution of resources and products.</p>
			]]></hotspot>
			<hotspot title="Agriculture" dynamic="true" x="20" y="349"><![CDATA[
				<h1>Agriculture</h1>
				<p style="font-size:80%">Agriculture emerged independently in several different parts of the world. The earliest evidence of agricultural activity discovered so far dates to the era after 9000 B.C.E., when peoples of Southwest Asia cultivated wheat and barley while domesticating sheep, goats, pigs, and cattle. Agriculture involved long hours of hard physical laborâ€”clearing land, preparing fields, planting seeds, pulling weeds, and harvesting crops. Yet agriculture made possible the production of abundant food supplies.</p>
			]]></hotspot>
			<hotspot title="Pastoralism" dynamic="true" x="243" y="349"><![CDATA[
				<h1>Pastoralism</h1>
				<p>A pastoral society is one in which nomadic peoples keep herds of animals and utilize every part of the animal to survive. Pastoral nomads sought to obtain agricultural products and manufactured goods from settled peoples. In exchange, the nomads &quot;traded&quot; their knowledge of migratory routes and the carrying ability of their pack animals to lead vast trade caravans.</p>
			]]></hotspot>
			<hotspot title="Commerce" dynamic="true" x="461" y="6"><![CDATA[
				<h1>Commerce</h1>
				<p>Commerce is the system where people invest in trading ventures or in mass quantities of commercial goods to make profits.</p>
			]]></hotspot>
			<hotspot title="Labor Systems" dynamic="true" x="461" y="349"><![CDATA[
				<h1>Labor Systems</h1>
				<p>Labor systems refer to the way workers are organized in a society. During Egypt's Old Kingdom, for example, some 84,000 laborers worked to build the massive pyramidsâ€”but they were off-season farmers, not slaves. In many other societies, serfs and slaves provided labor for those who held power.</p>
			]]></hotspot>
			<hotspot title="Industrialization" dynamic="true" x="243" y="6"><![CDATA[
				<h1>Industrialization</h1>
				<p>Industrialization refers to the process that changed agricultural and handicraft-centered economies into economies distinguished by industry and machine manufacture. The principal features of industrialization were technological and organizational changes that transformed manufacturing and led to increased productivity.</p>
			]]></hotspot>
			<hotspot title="Capitalism" dynamic="true" x="133" y="78"><![CDATA[
				<h1>Capitalism</h1>
				<p>Capitalism is a market economic system in which producers, acting in their own self-interest, make their goods and services available in a free market, and compete with other producers. Citizens own private property and take risks using their means of production in order to generate profits. Government is not involved in economic matters.</p>
			]]></hotspot>
			<hotspot title="Socialism" dynamic="true" x="354" y="78"><![CDATA[
				<h1>Socialism</h1>
				<p style="font-size:80%">Socialism is both a political and an economic theory of social organization based on the collective ownership of the factors of production. Its origins were in the early nineteenth century, and it differs from communism by a desire for slow or moderate change, compared with the communist call for revolution. Socialism today implies that government owns some factors of production and provides domestic support programs.</p>

			<hotspot title="Benefits" dynamic="true" x="273" y="107"><![CDATA[
				<h1>Benefits</h1>
				<p>Benefits of industrialization included cheap manufactured goods, an increased standard of living, and population growth. Reductions in the price of clothing meant that more people had more than one change of clothing. The price of food went down as a result of efficient agricultural machinery and steam-powered railroad transportation.</p>
			]]></hotspot>
			<hotspot title="Pollution" dynamic="true" x="143" y="48"><![CDATA[
				<h1>Pollution</h1>
				<p>Increased industry and population caused severe air and water pollution. The burning of fuels such as coal and wood filled the air with poisons. Human sewage and waste from factories flowed freely into streets, streams, and rivers. Contaminated water supplies led to epidemics of cholera, typhus, and tuberculosis. Cramped, filthy living conditions also bred crime.</p>
			]]></hotspot>
			<hotspot title="Social Changes" dynamic="true" x="49" y="218"><![CDATA[
				<h1>Social Changes</h1>
				<p style="font-size:80%">Industrialization changed the social class organization in most countries. New classes of wealthy businessmen challenged the privileges of the nobility and military. The middle class grew, and gender roles became separate spheres. Men's position in society was enhanced as they left the home for factory jobs. Middle-class women were relegated to domestic chores and raising children. Lower-class women often became domestic servants to the increasingly wealthy middle class.</p>
			]]></hotspot>
			<hotspot title="Child Labor" dynamic="true" x="380" y="242"><![CDATA[
				<h1>Child Labor</h1>
				<p>Working-class children were hired at factories and in mines. They worked extremely long hours for little pay. The abuses were so noteworthy that the British Parliament held investigations and passed laws in the 1840s to regulate and restrict child labor.</p>

				<h1>Class Distinctions</h1>
				<p>Class distinctions refer to levels of society based on wealth or profession. Monarchs were often at the pinnacle of society, with nobles and priests or priestesses closely connected to them. Craft workers, soldiers, and farmers usually were on the next rungs of society. The lower classes consisted of landless peasants and slaves.</p>
			]]></hotspot>
			<hotspot title="Professional Classes" dynamic="true" x="461" y="349"><![CDATA[
				<h1>Professional Classes</h1>
				<p>The &quot;professional classes&quot; throughout history encompass people who spent no time on agricultural production. Priests, political managers, bureaucrats, and artisans, for example, focused on their work without concern for basic subsistence.</p>
			]]></hotspot>
			<hotspot title="Patriarchal Society" dynamic="true" x="461" y="6"><![CDATA[
				<h1>Patriarchal Society</h1>
				<p>A patriarchal society is one in which men dominate public and home life, and descent is recognized through the male line. In early patriarchal societies, men legally had the ability to sell their wives and children into slavery.</p>
			]]></hotspot>
			<hotspot title="Caste System" dynamic="true" x="243" y="349"><![CDATA[
				<h1>Caste System</h1>
				<p>The caste system of ancient India strictly separated individuals in society. The system included four main varnas, or social distinctions. Each varna expanded over time to include  thousands of subcastes known as jati that were strictly tied to occupation. Elaborate behavioral rules developed for each jati with severe consequences for violation of jati rules.</p>
			]]></hotspot>
			<hotspot title="Ancestor Worship" dynamic="true" x="20" y="349"><![CDATA[
				<h1>Ancestor Worship</h1>
				<p>The veneration of ancestors has its origins in Neolithic times. A family could expect to prosper only if all its membersâ€”living and deadâ€”worked cooperatively toward common interests.</p>
			]]></hotspot>
			<hotspot title="Extended Family" dynamic="true" x="20" y="6"><![CDATA[
				<h1>Extended Family</h1>
				<p>An extended family is a household made up of several generations, including grandparents, parents, and children.</p>
			]]></hotspot>
			<hotspot title="Nuclear Family" dynamic="true" x="243" y="6"><![CDATA[
				<h1>Nuclear Family</h1>
				<p>A nuclear family is a family group that includes only parents and their children.</p>
