		<mainText><![CDATA[And therefore if any two men desire the same thing, which nevertheless they cannot both enjoy, they become enemies; and in the way to their end . . . endeavour to destroy or subdue one another. And from hence it comes to pass that where an invader hath no more to fear than another man's single power, if one plant, sow, build, or possess a convenient seat, others may probably be expected to come prepared with forces united to dispossess and deprive him, not only of the fruit of his labour, but also of his life or liberty.<br/><br/> . . .So that in the nature of man, we find three principal causes of quarrel. First, competition; secondly, diffidence; thirdly, glory.<br/><br/>The first maketh men invade for gain; the second, for safety; and the third, for reputation.<br/><br/> . . . Hereby it is manifest that during the time men live without a common power to keep them all in awe, they are in that condition which is called war; and such a war as is of every man against every man.]]></mainText>
