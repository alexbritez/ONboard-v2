			<popTitle>Speaker (Persona)</popTitle>
			<popInfo><![CDATA[<p>At the top of the pyramid we have the speaker. In this case, the speaker is President Roosevelt. It is important that we think of the speaker as President Roosevelt instead of the man, Franklin D. Roosevelt, because he is speaking in his publicly elected persona. Sometimes the speaker is the same as the persona, but often there is a subtle distinction.</p>]]></popInfo>

			<popTitle>Audience</popTitle>
			<popInfo><![CDATA[<p>The audience for this speech is twofold. President Roosevelt is addressing Congress directly. However, President Roosevelt would have expected that his speech would also be relayed to the American public—either by radio or newspaper. Therefore, the speech has two audiences—Congress and the American people.</p>]]></popInfo>

			<popTitle>Subject</popTitle>
			<popInfo><![CDATA[<p>The subject of the speech is more complicated than one might originally think. President Roosevelt is speaking on the occasion of the bombing of Pearl Harbor. This event provides the purpose for the speech. But in this case, the true subject of the speech is declaring war.</p>]]></popInfo>
