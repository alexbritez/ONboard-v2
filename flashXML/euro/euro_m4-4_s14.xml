		<mainText><![CDATA[Only in one state in eastern Europe was strong central authority maintained in the sixteenth century: the Ottoman Empire. From his capital in Constantinople, the sultan exercised unparalleled powers throughout the eastern Mediterranean and North Africa, and the Ottomans prevented any serious challenges to their empire until they began to lose ground to the Hapsburgs in the eighteenth century.
The first sign of weakening at the center began to appear after the death in 1566 of the sultan whose conquests brought the empire to its largest size, Suleiman II. Suleiman had gained control of the Balkans with a victory at Mohacs in 1526, and he had even briefly laid siege to Vienna [Austria] in 1529. Under his successors, the determined exercise of authority that had marked his rule began to decline; harem intrigues, corruption at court, and the loosening of military discipline became increasingly serious. Yet the Ottomans remained an object of fear and hostility throughout the West—a constant threat to central Europe from the Balkans and, despite naval setbacks, a formidable force in the eastern Mediterranean.
