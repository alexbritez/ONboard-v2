The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.
	He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.
	He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.
	He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.
	He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.
	He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.
	He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.
	He has endeavored to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.
	He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.
	He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.
	He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people, and eat out their substance.
	He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.
	He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.
	He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:
For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:
For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:
For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:
For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:
For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by jury:
For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences:
For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighboring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:
For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:
For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.
	He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.
	He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.
	He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to complete the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & Perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.
	He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.
	He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.

Let’s Dance!]]></header><text><![CDATA[<font face='c-Bold'>Introduction Draft</font><br/>	If you take any English class, you will be asked to write an argument or persuasive essay. This task asks that you choose a controversial topic, take a position or give an informed opinion on the issue, and then convince your audience or reader that you have a valid opinion. Traditionally, students learn that an argument is war. Applying this metaphor, they see anyone who does not agree with their point as an <font face='lc-Italic'>enemy</font>. They <font face='lc-Italic'>challenge</font> and <font face='lc-Italic'>attack</font> the opponent’s claims while <font face='lc-Italic'>aggressively</font> defending their own. Next, they <font face='lc-Italic'>target the indefensible</font> weak points, and then they <font face='lc-Italic'>counterattack</font> and <font face='lc-Italic'>shoot down</font> those claims in order to <font face='lc-Italic'>maim</font> or <font face='lc-Italic'>kill</font> the assertions made by the <font face='lc-Italic'>enemy</font>. Often, they use <font face='lc-Italic'>fighting</font> words to <font face='lc-Italic'>defend</font> their position on the topic so that by the end of the essay, the audience is left with the memory of a <font face='lc-Italic'>vicious</font> verbal <font face='lc-Italic'>battle</font>. Please, stop the nonsense! Let us be more civilized. The best argument essays are like a dance in which the writer takes the lead and guides the audience to see his position as a valid one.]]></text></content><audio>eng_m3-6_s42</audio><credits><![CDATA[(tr)C Squared Studios/Getty Images; (bkgd)Grant Faint/Photographer's Choice/Getty Images.]]></credits></scene><scene id="43" type="3_txt_img_reading"><content><header><![CDATA[]]></header><text><![CDATA[<font face='c-Bold'>Body Draft</font><br/>	First, the writer sets the stage for the performance. He must understand the controversial topic and be enthusiastic about discussing his viewpoints just as a dancer must know and be eager to use a musical selection. In preparation, both the writer and the dancer must consider who is in the audience and how the audience feels about the selected topic. The writer needs to identify the situation or issue and present the controversial points clearly. Then, if the writer has any technical or special vocabulary pertaining to the topic, he needs to define these key terms. The dancer, in similar fashion, identifies major points and defines special vocabulary in the Playbill, or the performance booklet that the audience receives upon entering the theater. Also, both the writer and the dancer must establish parameters, the boundaries or limitations of their delivery. Finally, they need to take the lead and clearly establish their position to let the audience know where they stand on the stage for this topic or selection.<br/>	After they have set the stage, the writer and the dancer are ready to start the show by taking a position and engaging the audience. An important factor with any performance is to know the audience and to understand how best to interact with it. According to the Greek philosopher Aristotle, a person can apply three types of appeal to connect to the public. The first, ethos, is an ethical appeal that helps the writer or the dancer to establish his credibility, either through his own credentials or through those that he uses to accompany him. In the dancer’s case, his accompaniment consists of the experts he uses for choreography, musical interpretations, and/or co-performers. In the writer’s case, he is accompanied by the sources he cites. No true performer faces the audience in isolation. <br/>	A second type of appeal, logos, is the logical appeal in which the writer states his evidence by citing facts, presenting statistics, or using logic and reason. This logical appeal may seem unnecessary for a dancer, but the dancer also must maintain a logical sense of rhythm and patterns. One must remember that music is a mathematical and therefore logical equation. Depending on the topic or selection, the writer and dancer want to choose carefully how to use these appeals in engaging their audience.<br/>	Pathos, the third way to engage the public, is an appeal to the emotions of the audience. The writer presents specific anecdotes and evidence to produce a desired feeling and reaction toward his position on the topic. Likewise, the dancer evokes a specific emotion through his facial expressions and body movements.<br/>	For the body paragraphs or the main section of the performance, the writer needs to gather and evaluate evidence. In the dance metaphor, this is the time to choose the choreography. In any routine or presentation, the dancer can Cha-Cha-Cha as well as Two-Step for a more interesting, fresh performance. Like the dancer, the writer must carefully choose his choreography by skillfully gathering and evaluating his evidence. Therefore, the writer must consider the steps that he will take in pulling evidence to give support to his main point or assertion. First, he can <font face='lc-Italic'>Hip-Hop</font> with current events, or check the news for any event that could support his assertion. Second, in searching for evidence, he can <font face='lc-Italic'>Fox Trot</font> with history, or use his interdisciplinary connection and recall what he learned in social studies classes. A third way to find evidence is to make a connection to something in literature and <font face='lc-Italic'>Waltz</font> with a literary theme. Finally, he can count on his own experience for evidence to support his assertion, and <font face='lc-Italic'>Swing</font> with a personal anecdote.<br/>	In evaluating evidence, the writer, like the dancer, must assess the effectiveness of his routine. First, the information must be relevant to his main point. Second, the evidence must represent a variety of sources rather than just one or two. Third, the evidence should be sufficient to leave the audience satisfied. Furthermore, he should be careful not to take any missteps, such as presenting vague or false information. These missteps or logical fallacies would make him lose credibility with his public. <br/>	Just as a dancer would bow to acknowledge his competitor, the writer should give credit to the best points of the opposing argument. That is, he should concede valid points on the other side. However, he should also be prepared to surpass those points with his rebuttal. This is similar to the dancer’s attitude saying, “You’re good, but watch me outperform you.” Snap!<br/>	Lastly is the grand finale. Comparatively, the writer and the dancer will remind the audience of how important this performance has been. They will leave their public applauding for an encore. And long after they have left the stage, the audience will recall and be influenced by the echo of the dance steps.]]></text></content><audio>eng_m3-6_s43</audio><credits><![CDATA[(tr)C Squared Studios/Getty Images; (bkgd)Grant Faint/Photographer's Choice/Getty Images.]]></credits></scene><scene id="44" type="3_txt_img_reading"><content><header><![CDATA[]]></header><text><![CDATA[<font face='c-Bold'>Conclusion Draft</font><br/>	To watch politicians bicker, one can see that the debate currently belongs to a culture of war. Debaters confront their rival, strike, and retaliate as they shoot down each other’s claims with the intent to cripple or destroy their opponent’s assertions. However, a carefully choreographed <font face='lc-Italic'>Two-Step</font>, <font face='lc-Italic'>Twist</font>, or <font face='lc-Italic'>Tango</font> can just as easily and more gracefully persuade an audience through a show of facts and examples.
