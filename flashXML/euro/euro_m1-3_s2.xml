			<popTitle>Law or Code</popTitle>
			<popInfo>Laws applied to the entire kingdom and were thus distinct from local customs which came to be called common law. Common law is most associated with England. The Napoleonic or Civil Code was made possible by the French Revolution. The new civil code liquidated the manorial system, established religious toleration, and reduced the power of the guilds. The nobility lost many of its privileges and careers were open to anyone with talent. The code was seen as a boost to individual freedom.
