		<mainText><![CDATA[In 1894 a French military court found Captain Alfred Dreyfus, a Jewish army officer, guilty of treason for leaking secret military documents to the German embassy in Paris. Dreyfus was deported to life imprisonment at Devil’s Island, but evidence accumulated to show his innocence and to indicate the guilt of another officer, Major Esterhazy, an adventurer known to be riddled with gambling debts. But the army refused to reopen the case, unwilling to admit it had erred; a staff officer, Major Henry, even forged documents to confirm Dreyfus’s guilt. Meanwhile, anti-Semites, royalists, traditionalists, militarists, and most of the ‘best’ people fought the reopening of the case, deeming it unpatriotic to shake the nation’s confidence in the army and wishing also to disgrace the republican regime. [Here, “republican regime” means a democratic government, with an elected president and a representative legislature, unlike a monarchy or totalitarian regime.] The partisans of Dreyfus stubbornly upheld him, both because they believed in justice and because they wished to discredit their antirepublican adversaries. The country was deeply split into political and cultural factions that defended or attacked republicanism with arguments that repeated the bitter ideological conflicts of every French revolution since 1789. Finally, following a passionate pro-Dreyfus campaign by writers such as Emile Zola, Dreyfus was pardoned by the French president in 1899 and granted complete legal exoneration in 1906. <br /><br /><font size = "14">From A HISTORY OF THE MODERN WORLD, 10th edition, by R.R.
