The United States was at peace with that nation and, at the solicitation of Japan, was still in conversation with its government and its emperor looking toward the maintenance of peace in the Pacific.
Indeed, one hour after Japanese air squadrons had commenced bombing in the American island of Oahu, the Japanese ambassador to the United States and his colleague delivered to our Secretary of State a formal reply to a recent American message. And while this reply stated that it seemed useless to continue the existing diplomatic negotiations, it contained no threat or hint of war or of armed attack.
It will be recorded that the distance of Hawaii from Japan makes it obvious that the attack was deliberately planned many days or even weeks ago. During the intervening time, the Japanese government has deliberately sought to deceive the United States by false statements and expressions of hope for continued peace.
The attack yesterday on the Hawaiian islands has caused severe damage to American naval and military forces. I regret to tell you that very many American lives have been lost. In addition, American ships have been reported torpedoed on the high seas between San Francisco and Honolulu.
Yesterday, the Japanese government also launched an attack against Malaya.
Last night, Japanese forces attacked Hong Kong.
Last night, Japanese forces attacked Guam.
Last night, Japanese forces attacked the Philippine Islands.
Last night, the Japanese attacked Wake Island.
And this morning, the Japanese attacked Midway Island.
Japan has, therefore, undertaken a surprise offensive extending throughout the Pacific area. The facts of yesterday and today speak for themselves. The people of the United States have already formed their opinions and well understand the implications to the very life and safety of our nation.
As commander in chief of the Army and Navy, I have directed that all measures be taken for our defense. But always will our whole nation remember the character of the onslaught against us.
No matter how long it may take us to overcome this premeditated invasion, the American people in their righteous might will win through to absolute victory.
I believe that I interpret the will of the Congress and of the people when I assert that we will not only defend ourselves to the uttermost, but will make it very certain that this form of treachery shall never again endanger us.
Hostilities exist. There is no blinking at the fact that our people, our territory, and our interests are in grave danger.
With confidence in our armed forces, with the unbounding determination of our people, we will gain the inevitable triumph—so help us God.
I ask that the Congress declare that since the unprovoked and dastardly attack by Japan on Sunday, December 7th, 1941, a state of war has existed between the United States and the Japanese empire.

For I have sworn before you and Almighty God the same solemn oath our forebears prescribed nearly a century and three-quarters ago.
The world is very different now. For man holds in his mortal hands the power to abolish all forms of human poverty and all forms of human life. And yet the same revolutionary beliefs for which our forebears fought are still at issue around the globe—the belief that the rights of man come not from the generosity of the state, but from the hand of God.
We dare not forget today that we are the heirs of that first revolution. Let the word go forth from this time and place, to friend and foe alike, that the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans—born in this century, tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace, proud of our ancient heritage, and unwilling to witness or permit the slow undoing of those human rights to which this nation has always been committed, and to which we are committed today at home and around the world.]]></text></content><audio>eng_m1-3_s17</audio><credits><![CDATA[(tr)C Squared Studios/Getty Images; (bkgd)Grant Faint/Photographer's Choice/Getty Images.]]></credits></scene><scene id="18" type="9_Activity_Image_Rollclick"><content><header>Ethos in Kennedy’s Inaugural Address</header><instruction><![CDATA[]]></instruction></content><activity type="image"><image>eng_m1-3_s18.jpg</image><hotspots><hotspot title="" dynamic="true" x="656" y="161"><![CDATA[<h1></h1><p>Kennedy swears to God, suggesting his ethical fortitude.</p>]]></hotspot><hotspot title="" dynamic="true" x="738" y="189"><![CDATA[<h1></h1><p>Kennedy refers back to the legacy of men who have gone before him who have also been sworn into office.</p>]]></hotspot><hotspot title="" dynamic="true" x="714" y="351"><![CDATA[<h1></h1><p>Kennedy references beliefs in the rights of man and the sovereignty of God rather than the state.</p>]]></hotspot></hotspots></activity><audio>eng_m1-3_s18</audio><credits><![CDATA[(tr)C Squared Studios/Getty Images; (bkgd)Grant Faint/Photographer's Choice/Getty Images.]]></credits></scene><scene id="19" type="2_Txt_Img_Animation"><video>eng_m1-3_s19</video><credits><![CDATA[(tr bc)C Squared Studios/Getty Images; (br)Don Farrall/Digital Vision/Getty Images;      (bkgd)Grant Faint/Photographer's Choice/Getty Images.]]></credits></scene><scene id="20" type="9_Activity_Image_Rollclick"><content><header>Logos in Kennedy’s Inaugural Address</header><instruction><![CDATA[]]></instruction></content><activity type="image"><image>eng_m1-3_s20.jpg</image><hotspots><hotspot title="Logos" dynamic="true" x="452.85" y="100.3"><![CDATA[<h1>Logos</h1><p>Kennedy is pointing out a long standing tradition.</p>]]></hotspot><hotspot title="Logos" dynamic="true" x="452.85" y="313.3"><![CDATA[<h1>Logos</h1><p>This statement is a logical juxtaposition.</p>]]></hotspot></hotspots></activity><audio>eng_m1-3_s20</audio><credits><![CDATA[(tr)C Squared Studios/Getty Images; (bkgd)Grant Faint/Photographer's Choice/Getty Images.]]></credits></scene><scene id="21" type="7_Activity_Drag_Drop"><matchingInstructions>Match the items on the left to the correct areas on the right.</matchingInstructions><matching type="dynamic" deductionFactor="2" maxAttempts="3" hasPoints="true" points="6"><matches><match id="2"><![CDATA[Pathos]]></match><match id="3"><![CDATA[Logos]]></match><match id="1"><![CDATA[Ethos]]></match></matches><drops title="" children-styles="margin-bottom: 0.1em;"><drop correct="1" x="57" y="96"/><drop correct="2" x="57" y="177"/><drop correct="3" x="57" y="264"/></drops><image>eng_m1-3_s21.jpg</image></matching><instructions>When you are done, check your results by clicking 'Check Answers.'</instructions><audio>eng_m1-3_s21</audio><credits><![CDATA[(tr)C Squared Studios/Getty Images; (bkgd)Grant Faint/Photographer's Choice/Getty Images.]]></credits></scene><scene id="22" type="2_Txt_Img_Animation"><video>eng_m1-3_s22</video><credits><![CDATA[(tr)C Squared Studios/Getty Images; (bkgd)Grant Faint/Photographer's Choice/Getty Images.]]></credits></scene><scene id="23" type="7_Activity_Drag_Drop"><matchingInstructions>Match the items on the left to the correct areas on the right.</matchingInstructions><matching type="dynamic" deductionFactor="2" maxAttempts="3" hasPoints="true" points="6"><matches><match id="9"><![CDATA[Persuasion]]></match><match id="4"><![CDATA[Process Analysis]]></match><match id="7"><![CDATA[Definition]]></match><match id="5"><![CDATA[Comparison and Contrast]]></match><match id="1"><![CDATA[Narration]]></match><match id="2"><![CDATA[Description]]></match><match id="8"><![CDATA[Classification]]></match><match id="6"><![CDATA[Cause and Effect]]></match><match id="3"><![CDATA[Illustration]]></match></matches><drops title="" children-styles="margin-bottom: 0.1em;"><drop correct="1" x="20" y="71"/><drop correct="2" x="20" y="129"/><drop correct="3" x="20" y="187"/><drop correct="4" x="20" y="265"/><drop correct="5" x="20" y="351"/><drop correct="6" x="304" y="92"/><drop correct="7" x="304" y="183"/><drop correct="8" x="304" y="254"/><drop correct="9" x="304" y="338"/></drops><image>eng_m1-3_s23.jpg</image></matching><instructions>When you are done, check your results by clicking 'Check Answers.'</instructions><audio>eng_m1-3_s23</audio><credits><![CDATA[(tr)C Squared Studios/Getty Images; (bkgd)Grant Faint/Photographer's Choice/Getty Images.]]></credits></scene><scene id="24" type="3_txt_img_reading"><content><header><![CDATA[]]></header><text><![CDATA[“I was born in 1913.

Board of Education,</font> 1954</p>]]></header><text><![CDATA[Today, education is perhaps the most important function of state and local governments. Compulsory school attendance laws and the great expenditures for education both demonstrate our recognition of the importance of education to our democratic society. It is required in the performance of our most basic public responsibilities, even service in the armed forces. It is the very foundation of good citizenship. Today it is a principal instrument in awakening the child to cultural values, in preparing him for later professional training, and in helping him to adjust normally to his environment. In these days, it is doubtful that any child may reasonably be expected to succeed in life if he is denied the opportunity of an education. Such an opportunity, where the state has undertaken to provide it, is a right which must be made available to all on equal terms. 
We come then to the question presented: Does segregation of children in public schools solely on the basis of race, even though the physical facilities and other "tangible" factors may be equal, deprive the children of the minority group of equal educational opportunities? We believe that it does.

There is no reason to believe that typhoid or scarlet fever or phthisis can be successfully treated by a woman physician in one way and by a man physician in another way. There is indeed every reason to believe that unless treated in the best way the patient may die, the sex of the doctor affecting the result less even than the sex of the patient. The question needs only to be put for us to feel irrevocably sure that there is no special woman’s way of dealing with disease.<br/><br/><font size='12'>Source: “Should the Higher Education of Women Differ from That of Men?” by M.
