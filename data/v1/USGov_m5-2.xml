				<p><strong>Opinion 1</strong></p>
				<p>Reintroduction of the draft would be good for the military and the nation in general. Service to one's country is a duty of citizenship. The need to reintroduce the draft has become urgent as the military faces a potential crisis in troop strength. Furthermore, the reliance on an all-volunteer force has meant that military service has fallen disproportionately on the sons and daughters of America's poor. Attracted by the economic and educational opportunities the military offers, minorities in particular take on a disproportionate share of the risks of protecting the nation. A draft would create public pressure on our government not to enter into unnecessary conflicts.</p>

			&quot;I was born in a little town called Hope, Arkansas, three months after my father died. I remember that old two-story house where I lived with my grandparents. They had very limited incomes. It was in 1963 that I went to Washington and met President Kennedy at the Boy's Nation program. And I remember just thinking what an incredible country this was, that somebody like me, you know, who had no money or anything, would be given the opportunity to meet the president. That's when I decided I could really do public service because I cared so much about people. I worked my way through law school with part time jobs, anything I could find. After I graduated I really didn't care about making a lot of money. I just wanted to go home and see if I could make a difference. We've worked hard in education and health care to create jobs and we've made real progress. Now it's exhilarating to me to think that as president I could help to change all our people's lives for the better and bring hope back to the American dream.&quot;
