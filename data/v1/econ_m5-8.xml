				<h1>Recession</h1>
				<p>A <strong>contraction</strong> occurs when GDP is decreasing. In this phase, unemployment is increasing. Businesses lay off workers because consumers aren't buying as many goods and services. If a contraction lasts longer than two consecutive quarters, it is called a recession.</p>

				<p>Between 2001 and 2008, the U.S. was experiencing an <strong>economic expansion</strong>. That means the GDP was growing each year, and American incomes were increasing. This was caused by the boom in new technology, especially increased access to cell phones and the Internet, which made businesses more efficient.</p>

				<p>Between 2008 and mid-2009, the U.S. GDP dropped for four straight quarters. This is called a <strong>contraction</strong> or a <strong>recession</strong>. Business investment and consumer spending both decreased, due to the banking crisis and the drop in housing prices.</p>

				<p>According to this graph, the U.S. GDP hit a low point or <strong>trough</strong> in the second quarter of 2009. The economy began to turn around, partly because of government stabilization policies and partly due to improved efficiency in business firms.</p>

				<p>In this period, the GDP is growing, but it is still not back to the previous high. This is called a <strong>recovery</strong>. Government policies and improved consumption helped the recovery along.</p>
