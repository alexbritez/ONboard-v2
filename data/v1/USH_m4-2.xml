The American-dominated sugar plantation system not only displaced native Hawaiians from their lands but also sought to build a workforce with Asian immigrants, whom the Americans considered more reliable and more docile than the natives.

The result was devastating to the economy of the islands, and American planters concluded that the only way for them to recover was to become part of the United States (and hence exempt from its tariffs).

		 	<h1>Economic Ties to Britain</h1>
			<p>Economic realities also made it impossible for the United States to deal with the belligerents on equal terms. The British had imposed a naval blockade on Germany to prevent munitions and supplies from reaching the enemy. As a neutral, the United States had the right, in theory, to trade with both Britain and Germany; but for Americans to trade with Germany, they would have to defy the British blockade. A truly neutral response to the blockade would have been to stop trading with Britain as well. But while the United States could survive an interruption of its relatively modest trade with the Central Powers, it could not easily weather an embargo on its much more extensive trade with the Allies, particularly when war orders from Britain and France soared after 1914, helping to produce one of the greatest economic booms in the nation's history. So America tacitly ignored the blockade of Germany and continued trading with Britain. By 1915, the United States had gradually transformed itself from a neutral power into the arsenal of the Allies.</p>

					<p>The migrating Puritans &quot;knew they were pilgrims&quot; even before they left Holland, their leader and historian William Bradford, later wrote. In September 1620 they left the port of Plymouth, on the English coast, in the <em>Mayflower</em> with thirty-five &quot;saints&quot; (Puritan Separatists) and sixty-seven &quot;strangers&quot; (people who were not full members of the church) aboard. By the time they sighted land in November, it was too late in the year to go on. Their original destination was probably the mouth of the Hudson River, in what is now New York. But they found themselves instead on Cape Cod. After exploring the region for a while, they chose a site for their settlement just north of the cape, an area Captain John Smith had named &quot;Plymouth&quot; (after the English port from which the Puritans had sailed) during an exploratory journey some years before. Plymouth lay outside the [Virginia] Company's territory, and the settlers realized they had no legal basis for settling there. As a result, forty-one male passengers signed a document, the Mayflower Compact, which established a civil government and proclaimed their allegiance to the king. Then, on December 21, 1820, the Pilgrims stepped ashore at Plymouth Rock.</p>
