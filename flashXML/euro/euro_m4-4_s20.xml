		<correctText><![CDATA[<font size='11'>Paragraphs should note the following:<br/>James was a king so his point of view was that of a monarch.<br/>James was biased towards the divine right of kings because he was a king.<br/>The members of the House of Commons were elected officials so their point of view establishes the importance of the House of Commons to running the nation.<br/>The members of the House of Commons were biased towards a limited monarchy that respected the powers and views of Parliament because they were elected officials. <br/>King James I and the members of the House of Commons have different points of view.
