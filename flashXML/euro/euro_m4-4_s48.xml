While the agricultural base was being revolutionized, industrialization went rapidly forward. At first there was considerable dependence on the capitalist countries. Engineers and other technicians from western Europe and the United States went to work in the Soviet Union. Much machinery was imported. But the worldwide depression that set in about 1931, bringing a catastrophic fall of agricultural prices, made foreign-made machines more costly in terms of the cereals that were the chief Soviet export. The international situation also deteriorated. 
. . . No ten years in the history of any Western country ever showed such a rate of industrial growth as the decade of the first two plans in the Soviet Union. In Great Britain industrialization had been gradual; in Germany and the United States it has been more rapid, and in each country there had been decades in which output of coal or iron doubled; but in the U.S.S. R, from 1928 to 1938, production of iron and steel expanded four times and that of coal expanded three and a half times. In 1938 the U.S.S.R. was the world’s largest producer of farm tractors and railway locomotives. Four-fifths of all its industrial output came from plants built in the proceeding ten years. In 1939 the U.S.S. R., as measured by purely quantitative standards, was surpassed in gross industrial output only by the United States and Germany.
