		<mainText><![CDATA[5. The pope does not intend to remit, and cannot remit any penalties other than those which he has imposed either by his own authority or by that of the Canons.
6. The pope cannot remit any guilt, except by declaring that it has been remitted by God and by assenting to God’s remission; though, to be sure, he may grant remission in cases reserved to his judgment. 
__________________________
8. The penitential canons are imposed only on the living, and, according to them, nothing should be imposed on the dying.
9. Therefore the Holy Spirit in the pope is kind to us, because in his decrees he always makes exceptions of the articles of death and of necessity. 
10. Ignorant and wicked are the doings of those priests who, in the case of the dying, reserve canonical penances for purgatory.
11. The changing of the canonical penalty to the penalty of purgatory is quite evidently one of the tares that were sown while the bishops slept.
_________________________
13. The dying are freed by death from all penalties; they are already dead to canonical rules, and have a right to be released from them.
_____________________________
20. Therefore by “full remission of all penalties” the pope means not actually “of all,” but only of those imposed by himself.
21. Therefore those preachers of indulgences are in error, who say that by the pope’s indulgences a man is freed from every penalty, and saved;
_____________________________
24. It must needs be, therefore, that the greater part of the people are deceived by that indiscriminate and highsounding promise of release from penalty. 
27. They preach man who say that so soon as the penny jingles into the money box, the soul flies out [of purgatory]. 
28. It is certain that when the penny jingles into the money-box, gain and avarice [greed] can be increased, but the result of the intercession of the Church is in the power of God alone.]]></mainText>
