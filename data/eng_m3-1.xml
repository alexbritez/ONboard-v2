Through constant polishing and refinement, the project grew from a brief inclination to a grand and heartwarming tale that would guarantee a successful premiere. He leaned back to admire his work, when suddenly the screen flickered and turned black as a thin stream of smoke wafted from the computer. With a sinking feeling, Tex realized that he had not backed up the hard drive that was more than likely melting away, taking months of work with it. Tears welling, his eyes darted across his work area searching desperately for answers.

His brows furrowed doubtfully and he pulled the end of his brown mustache.<br/>      It was quiet in the officer's room of Solar Station #5—except for the soft purring of the mighty Beam Director somewhere far below.<br/>     Robot QT-1 sat immovable. The burnished plates of his body gleamed in the Luxites and the glowing red of the photoelectric cells that were his eyes, were fixed steadily upon the Earthman at the other side of the table.<br/>     Powell repressed a sudden attack of nerves. These robots possessed peculiar brains. Oh, the three Laws of Robotics held. They had to. All of U. S. Robots, from Robertson himself to the new floor-sweeper would insist on that. So QT-1 was <font face='lc-Italic'>safe</font>! And yet—the QT models were the first of their kind, and this was the first of the QTs. Mathematical squiggles on paper were not always the most comforting protection against robotic fact.<br/>     Finally, the robot spoke. His voice carried the cold timbre inseparable from a metallic diaphragm, "Do you realize the seriousness of such a statement, Powell?"<br/>     "<font face="lc-Italic">Something</font> made you, Cutie," pointed out Powell. "You admit yourself that your memory seems to spring full-grown from an absolute blankness of a week ago. I'm giving you the explanation. Donovan and I put you together from the parts shipped us."<br/>     Cutie gazed upon his long, supple fingers in an oddly human attitude of mystification, "It strikes me that there should be a more satisfactory explanation than that. For <font face="lc-Italic">you</font> to make <font face="lc-Italic">me</font> seems improbable."

Introduction Paragraph<br/>     II. Body Paragraph <u>First Claim:</u> This is an eerie scene.<br/>          A. The <font color="#FF0000">"glowing red" robot's eyes</font> appear demonic.<br/>          B. The <font color="#FF0000">"quiet"</font> setting <font color="#FF0000">except for noise of "Beam Director"</font> surrounds an isolated<br/>              human.<br/>          C. The <font color="#FF0000">Robot's "cold timbre" voice</font> sounds unnatural.<br/>          D. The <font color="#FF0000">Robot's "oddly human attitude"</font> is disturbing.<br/>          E. The <font color="#FF0000">disturbing conversation between man and machine</font> occurs because the<br/>              machine can reason and think for itself.<br/>     III. Body Paragraph <u>Second Claim:</u> Powell is unsure, doubtful about the robot.<br/>          A. Powell shows he is unsure when <font color="#FF0000">"his brows furrowed doubtfully."</font><br/>          B. <font color="#FF0000">Syntax of fragments and dashes</font> shows anxiety.<br/>          C. Powell shows anxiety when he <font color="#FF0000">"repressed a sudden attack of nerves."</font><br/>          D. The word <font color="#FF0000">"<font face='lc-Italic'>safe</font>!" in italics</font> reveals that Powell is not really sure of the robot<br/>               but that he is trying to convince himself.<br/>          E. <font color="#FF0000">"Mathematical squiggles . . . against robot fact"</font> exposes Powell's lack of<br/>               certainty about the machine's capabilities.<br/>     IV. Body Paragraph <u>Third Claim:</u> It's ironic that the robot seems to be in control of<br/>           the situation.<br/>          A. <font color="#FF0000">Juxtaposition of logical, emotional machine to unsure, doubtful scientist</font><br/>              shows the irony of the machine being in control.<br/>          B. Irony is evident when the <font color="#FF0000">robot chastises man for the "seriousness of such a<br/>              statement"</font> in a role reversal of parental figure.<br/>          C. <font color="#FF0000">A machine questioning its creator</font> is unexpected.<br/>          D. Man did not plan for the <font color="#FF0000">"robotic fact"</font> that it could think for itself.<br/>          E. <font color="#FF0000">"For <font face='lc-Italic'>you</font> to make <font face='lc-Italic'>me</font> seems improbable."</font> For the machine to say this to his<br/>              creator is ironic because we do not expect a machine to be condescending<br/>              toward a human.<br/>     V.
