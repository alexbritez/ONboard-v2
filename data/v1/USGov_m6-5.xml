               <p>The New Deal was a series of economic programs implemented between 1933 and 1936. These included the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), which provided jobs such as planting trees and fighting fires. The Works Progress Administration (WPA) hired workers and artists to build and beautify highways, bridges, parks, and public buildings. Social Security—a government pension program for the elderly, disabled, and others—was also established.</p>
