			<![CDATA[<p>No ‘scutage' or ‘aid' may be levied in our kingdom without its general consent, unless it is for the ransom of our person, to make our eldest son a knight, and to marry our eldest daughter. For these purposes only a reasonable ‘aid' may be levied. Aids from the city of London are to be treated similarly. . . . 
										
		To obtain the general consent of the realm for the assessment of an ‘aid' - except in the three cases specified above - or a ‘scutage', we will cause the archbishops, bishops, abbots, earls, and greater barons to be summoned individually by letter. To those who hold lands directly of us we will cause a general summons to be issued, through the sheriffs and other officials, to come together on a fixed day (of which at least forty days notice shall be given) and at a fixed place. In all letters of summons, the cause of the summons will be stated. When a summons has been issued, the business appointed for the day shall go forward in accordance with the resolution of those present, even if not all those who were summoned have appeared.
