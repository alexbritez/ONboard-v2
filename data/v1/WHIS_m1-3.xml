				<p>Ashoka Maurya began his reign (268â€“232 B.C.E) as a conqueror but converted to Buddhism after the bloody battle of Kalinga. By Ashoka's estimate, 100,000 Kalingans died in the fighting, another 150,000 were driven from their homes, and untold numbers perished in the ruined land.</p>
			]]></hotspot>
			<hotspot dynamic="true" x="484" y="99"><![CDATA[
				<p>Throughout his empire, Ashoka had rocks and pillars inscribed with his edicts that expressed his intention to serve as a fair, just, and humane ruler. The edicts also encouraged his subjects to observe Buddhist values.</p>
			]]></hotspot>
			<hotspot dynamic="true" x="484" y="179"><![CDATA[
				<p>A central treasury oversaw the efficient collection of taxes, which supported legions of officials, accountants, clerks, soldiers, and other imperial employees. Ashoka encouraged the expansion of agriculture by building irrigation systems. He set up hospitals for the welfare of both people and animals.</p>

			<hotspot dynamic="true" x="484" y="259"><![CDATA[
				<p>Ashoka facilitated trade by building roads, most notably the Royal Road, which was more than 1,000 miles long. Ashoka provided comforts to merchants and other travelers by planting banyan trees for shade, digging wells, and establishing inns along the roads. India became a major crossroads in a trade network from the Pacific to the Mediterranean.</p>

			<hotspot dynamic="true" x="484" y="339"><![CDATA[
				<p>Although he converted to Buddhism, Ashoka respected other religions in his empire. In honor of the doctrine of nonviolence, he banned animal sacrifice in his capital city and gave up his beloved hunting trips. He sent missionaries to other lands and built monasteries and shrines to the Buddha. On top of many monuments, he included the wheel of dharma, or moral law. This wheel appears on India's flag today.</p>

		 	<p>From 1264 until his death in 1294, Kublai Khan ruled over the Mongol Empire at its height. In 1279, he proclaimed himself emperor over all of China and established the Yuan dynasty. Beyond China, however, Kublai had little success as a conqueror.</p>
			<p>In 1274 and again in 1281, Kublai attempted seaborne invasions of Japan. On both occasions, typhoons thwarted his plans. The storm of 1281 was especially vicious. It destroyed about 4,500 Mongol vessels carrying more than 100,000 armed troopsâ€”the largest seaborne expedition before World War II. Japanese defenders attributed their continued independence to the kamikaze, or "divine winds."</p>
