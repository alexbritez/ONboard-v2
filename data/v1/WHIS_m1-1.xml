         <text><![CDATA[
		 	<p>Cave and open-air paintings are some of the earliest known forms of art. They also can be considered a form of communication. Before many cultures developed a written language, humans used cave paintings to show their activities, ideas, and local plants and animals. Humans also created the art to pass along ideas to their descendants. The most famous cave paintings in Europe date as far back as 14,000 B.C.E. Two of the most well-known sites are Altamira in northern Spain and Lascaux Grotto in France, both of which feature similar images of wild oxen and bison.</p>

		 	<p>&quot;As this kingdom was so vast, in each of the many provinces there were many storehouses filled with supplies and other needful things; thus, in times of war, wherever the armies went they drew upon the contents of these storehouses, without ever touching the supplies of their confederates or laying a finger on what they had in their settlements. . . . Then the storehouses were filled up once more with the tributes paid the Inca. If there came a lean year, the storehouses were opened and the provinces were lent what they needed in way of supplies; then, in a year of abundance, they paid back all they had received. No one who was lazy or tried to live by the work of others was tolerated; everyone had to work. Thus on certain days each lord went to his lands and took the plow in hand and cultivated the earth, and did other things. Even the Inca [rulers] themselves did this to set an example. And under their system there was none such [laziness] in all the kingdom, for, if he had his health, he worked and lacked for nothing; and if he was ill, he received what he needed from the storehouses. And no rich man could deck himself out in more finery than the poor, or wear different clothing, except the rulers and the headmen, who, to maintain their dignity, were allowed great freedom and privilege.&quot;</p>

		 	<p>Don Affonso [King of Portugal, etc.]. To all who may see this our letter, we make known that, in order to defend, guard and preserve the trades of Guineea, the barters and mines of gold, and the commerce which rightly belongs to these kingdoms only and to no others, as is fitting for a matter of such importance, substance, moment and value, we, by this present letter, give the following power, authority, and special command to the captains, who at any time may be sent by my son, the prince etc., to the said Guineea: if they meet any caravels whatever, or any ships, of any people whatsoever of Espanha [Spain], or belonging to any other persons, who are, or may be, on their way out to the said Guineea or on their way back, or who are in it, in any manner whatsoever, beyond the boundaries, which by the agreed terms of the peace, made between our said kingdoms and those of Castile, have been appointed and declared, these boundaries and limits running downwards from the Canarias towards Guinea, that as soon as such persons shall have been seized, without any further order or course of law, all may be, and shall be, forthwith cast into the sea, so that they may then die a natural death; and they may not be carried to these kingdoms, or to any other parts, because they are to suffer punishment for trying and desiring to do something strictly forbidden and prohibited. It will be a good lesson to those, who may hear or learn of it, to beware of doing the like. Accordingly, we recommend my said son to order his said captains, whom he sends in future to the said Guineea, to do this accordingly, and to give them a special instruction to this effect; accordingly, we give him full authority, as we have and hold it, to do this and to command it to be so done. To certify all this, we command this our letter, signed by us and sealed with our seal, to be issued by him. Done in Vjana, on 6 April 1480.</p>
