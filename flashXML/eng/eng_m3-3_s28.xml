Decades before man landed on the moon and long before the establishment of the International Space Station, in an era when one of the most advanced technological achievements was the use of an airplane for aerial bombardment, Isaac Asimov was writing about space stations and humanlike robots. Asimov was not only an author and biochemist but also a futurist, predicting some amazing achievements such as housing men in outer space. Although filled with the promise of great accomplishments, Asimov poses some questions about man and the relationship with the machines he builds. The title of his book of short stories—<font face='lc-Italic'>I, Robot</font>—hints at the idea of a machine with a mind of its own. By creating an EERIE SITUATION, making the PROTAGONIST DOUBTFUL, and ending the passage with an IRONIC STATEMENT, Asimov reveals his skeptical attitude toward technology in his short story “Reason.”]]></mainText>
