		<mainText>Tragedy yields heroism. When the Twin Towers fell during the attack on 9/11, early preparation was the key to saving thousands of lives. Rick Rescorla, a retired Army Colonel, was serving as the director of security at Morgan Stanley at the time of the attacks. He took his job seriously and had intermittently required all staff to follow an evacuation plan he had developed.

Rescorla died that day, but his careful planning and attention to detail made him a hero to those he saved.</mainText>
