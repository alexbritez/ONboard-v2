		<mainText><![CDATA[<p>The Social Democrats led the government that faced the Great Depression and did the best they could with a shaky parliamentary majority and an uncooperative president. In 1930 the government resigned, to be replaced by the Center party and Heinrich Brüning, a cautious man with little popular appeal. 
The elections of 1930 gave Nazis more than a hundred new seats, from which they contemptuously disrupted parliamentary proceedings. His confidence growing, Hitler became a candidate for president in 1932, when [World War I-era Field Marshal Paul von] Hindenburg’s term expired. Worried politicians persuaded the nearly senile field marshal to run for reelection. Ludicrously cast as the defender of the constitution, the eighty-four-year-old Hindenburg won handily, but Hitler got more than 13 million votes. When Brüning proposed a financial reform that included expropriation of some East Prussian estates, Hindenburg dismissed him and turned to Franz von Papen, a friend of important army officers and Junkers. 
Hoping to create a right-wing coalition, von Papen lifted Brüning’s ban on the SA and SS, named four barons and a count to his cabinet, and declared martial law in Prussia so he could unseat the socialist government there. The outcry led Hindenburg to call another election. This one resulted in a Nazi landslide. With 40 percent of the Reichstag’s seats, the Nazis were by far its largest party. Hindenburg avoided naming Hitler chancellor by refusing to grant him the full decree powers he insisted on. The nation was sent to the polls again, and although the Nazis lost a little, they remained the largest party.
