		<mainText><![CDATA[<font face='c-Bold'>Introduction Draft</font><br/>	If you take any English class, you will be asked to write an argument or persuasive essay. This task asks that you choose a controversial topic, take a position or give an informed opinion on the issue, and then convince your audience or reader that you have a valid opinion. Traditionally, students learn that an argument is war. Applying this metaphor, they see anyone who does not agree with their point as an <font face='lc-Italic'>enemy</font>. They <font face='lc-Italic'>challenge</font> and <font face='lc-Italic'>attack</font> the opponent’s claims while <font face='lc-Italic'>aggressively</font> defending their own. Next, they <font face='lc-Italic'>target the indefensible</font> weak points, and then they <font face='lc-Italic'>counterattack</font> and <font face='lc-Italic'>shoot down</font> those claims in order to <font face='lc-Italic'>maim</font> or <font face='lc-Italic'>kill</font> the assertions made by the <font face='lc-Italic'>enemy</font>. Often, they use <font face='lc-Italic'>fighting</font> words to <font face='lc-Italic'>defend</font> their position on the topic so that by the end of the essay, the audience is left with the memory of a <font face='lc-Italic'>vicious</font> verbal <font face='lc-Italic'>battle</font>. Please, stop the nonsense! Let us be more civilized. The best argument essays are like a dance in which the writer takes the lead and guides the audience to see his position as a valid one.]]></mainText>
