				<h1>WHEN?</h1>
				<p>When did the event occur? The Declaration of Independence was written during the summer of 1776, between June 11 and July 1. Previous events include: The Boston Tea Party, 1773; the passage of the Intolerable Acts, 1774; fighting at Lexington and Concord, April 1775; and Olive Branch Petition rejected, August 1775.</p>

				<h1>WHAT?</h1>
				<p>What was the situation or condition during the event? Jefferson, Adams, and many other Revolutionary-era leaders were influenced by Enlightenment ideas, such as the natural rights of man. The founders also had economic reasons to declare independence, as the British had increased taxation and restricted settlement.
Politically, all three men in this painting could be considered treasonous British subjects.</p>

				<h1>WHERE?</h1>
				<p>Where did the event occur? Thomas Jefferson wrote his first draft of the Declaration of Independence in rooms rented from bricklayer Joseph Graff on the outskirts of Philadelphia. Jefferson rented two rooms from Graff, a small bedroom and a sitting room.</p>

            <hotspot audio="USH_m1-2_s10_who" dynamic="true" x="204" y="298" title="WHO?"><![CDATA[
				<h1>WHO?</h1>
				<p>Who was involved? The Continental Congress appointed five committee members from a geographic range of colonies (Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia). John Adams, from Massachusetts, urged the Virginian Thomas Jefferson to take the lead and draft the document justifying independence.</p>

		 	<p>One of the prerequisites for industrialization is an efficient system for transporting raw materials to factories and finished goods to markets. The United States had no such system in the early years of the republic. But work was under way that would ultimately remove the transportation obstacle.</p>
			<p>There were several ways to solve the problem of the small American markets. One was to look for customers overseas, and American merchants continued their efforts to do that. Among the first acts of the new Congress when it met in 1789 were two tariff bills giving preference to American ships in American ports, helping to stimulate an expansion of domestic shipping.</p>
			<p>More important—indeed the principal reason for the growth of American trade in this period—was the outbreak of war in Europe in the 1790s, allowing Yankee merchant vessels to take over most of the carrying trade between Europe and the Western Hemisphere.</p>
			<p>As early as 1793, the young republic had a merchant marine and a foreign trade larger than those of any country except England. In proportion to its population, the United States had more ships and international commerce than any country in the world. Between 1789 and 1810, the total tonnage of American vessels engaged in overseas traffic rose from less than 125,000 to nearly one million. American ships had carried only 30 percent of the country's exports in 1789; they were carrying over 90 percent in 1810. The figures for American ships carrying imports increased even more dramatically, from 17.5 percent to 90 percent in the same period.</p>
