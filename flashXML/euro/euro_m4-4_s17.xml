Already the Scottish monarch, James became King of England on the death of Elizabeth in 1603. James had a scholarly background and a reputation for his strong views about the monarchy. One of his clearest presentations of these views was a speech to Parliament made in 1610. In it he comments on the nature of the king’s power, not simply in England but everywhere.</font>
The state of Monarchy is the supremest thing upon earth; for kings are not only God’s lieutenants upon earth and sit upon God’s throne, but even by God himself they are called gods… In the Scriptures kings are called gods, and so their power after a certain relation compared to the Divine power.
