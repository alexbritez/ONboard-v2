		<mainText>The harpsichord and the piano are closely related. Both are keyboard instruments, and both produce sound when jacks or hammers attached to keys strike metal strings. The piano is a direct descendant of the harpsichord and takes its shape from that instrument. In fact, many musical compositions played on one can be adapted to the other. However, today the piano is the more popular of the two instruments. It is capable of producing greater volume and variety of tone, and it is more versatile than its predecessor. Pianos provide accompaniment for vocalists both classical and popular, and they are used in every instrumental group from the small dance band to the grandest symphony orchestra.</mainText>
