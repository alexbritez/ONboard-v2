<br/>War seems to be an inevitable part of the human experience. Depending on the circumstances, war is considered ennobling, necessary, and just. However, it may also be seen as corrupt, irrational, or even evil. Must war be an unavoidable part of human civilization? Is the sacrifice of war worth it? Do the casualties outweigh the causes? 
<br/>Read the following sources (including any introductory information) carefully. Then develop a position about what issues should be considered most important in making the decision to declare war.
<br/>Make sure that your argument is central; use the sources to illustrate and support your reasoning. Avoid merely summarizing the sources. Indicate clearly which sources you are drawing from, whether through direct quotation, paraphrase, or summary. You may cite the sources as Source A, Source B, etc., or by using the descriptions in parentheses.

Schlafly is a conservative activist who opposed the Equal Rights Amendment.<br/><br/>“The claim that American women are downtrodden and unfairly treated is the fraud of the century. The truth is that American women never had it so good. Why should we lower ourselves to “equal rights” when we already have the status of special privilege?<br/><br/>This [Equal Rights] Amendment will absolutely and positively make women subject to the draft.” <br/><font size='10'>Reprinted from <font face='c-Italic'>The Phyllis Schlafly Report</font>, Feb. 1972.</p>]]></text><header>View</header></figure></answers><feedbackAudio/></multiple></multiple_choice><audio>eng_m3-7_s23</audio><credits><![CDATA[(tr)C Squared Studios/Getty Images; (bkgd)Grant Faint/Photographer's Choice/Getty Images.]]></credits></scene><scene id="24" type="2_Txt_Img_Animation"><video>eng_m3-7_s24</video><credits><![CDATA[(tr)C Squared Studios/Getty Images; (c)MIKE PETERS EDTCTN (NEW) © KING FEATURES SYNDICATE;      (bkgd)Grant Faint/Photographer's Choice/Getty Images.]]></credits></scene><scene id="25" type="2_Txt_Img_Animation"><video>eng_m3-7_s25</video><credits><![CDATA[(tr)C Squared Studios/Getty Images; (bkgd)Grant Faint/Photographer's Choice/Getty Images.]]></credits></scene><scene id="26" type="Activity_Multiple_Choice"><instruction>instructions go here</instruction><multiple_choice><multiple><question><![CDATA[Which source used humor to achieve its purpose?]]></question><answers><answer correct="true">Source D</answer><answer>Source E</answer><figure/></answers><feedbackAudio/></multiple><multiple><question><![CDATA[Which source is more factual?]]></question><answers><answer>Source D</answer><answer correct="true">Source E</answer><figure/></answers><feedbackAudio/></multiple><multiple><question><![CDATA[Which source uses more current subject matter?]]></question><answers><answer>Source D</answer><answer correct="true">Source E</answer><figure/></answers><feedbackAudio/></multiple></multiple_choice><audio>eng_m3-7_s26</audio><credits><![CDATA[(tr)C Squared Studios/Getty Images; (bkgd)Grant Faint/Photographer's Choice/Getty Images.]]></credits></scene><scene id="27" type="2_Txt_Img_Animation"><video>eng_m3-7_s27</video><credits><![CDATA[(tr)C Squared Studios/Getty Images; (bkgd)Grant Faint/Photographer's Choice/Getty Images.]]></credits></scene><scene id="28" type="3_txt_img_reading"><content><header><![CDATA[Sample Introduction and Body Paragraph]]></header><text><![CDATA[<p>	The identity of any society revolves around its treatment of its citizens. As time progresses, society must re-evaluate this treatment in order to ensure that each citizen has an opportunity to achieve fulfillment. The United States struggles with this evaluation of identity in the realm of women’s rights. Since the country’s inception, the U.S. has dealt with victories and failures as its leaders and citizenry seek to establish just treatment for all members of the society. The success or failure of the fair and equal treatment of women in the United States will determine the society’s ultimate identity.
	The journey of the United States toward just treatment of all citizens must encompass an understanding of the history of inequality in order to appreciate the larger context of the struggle and move toward meaningful and relevant change. The struggle for women’s rights is not a new struggle; for centuries, women have understood that their identity within society was tenuous at best. Elizabeth Jones, in her address to a women’s rights convention in 1850, tackles the issue of equality by demanding that women be recognized as “equal members of the human family” (A). Jones’s views in 1850, while vehemently stated, were not extreme for her time period. In fact, almost a century earlier, Mary Wollstonecraft extols similar sentiments in <font face='lc-Italic'>Vindication of the Rights of Women</font>, exclaiming that “women must be allowed to found their virtue of knowledge . . . educated by the same pursuits as men” (B). Obviously, the issue of women’s rights is not restricted merely to the distant past and is, in fact, a fight taking place across the country’s history. Most recently, women endure wages far below their male counterparts (E). Through evaluating the role of this issue in the country’s larger cultural development, we can appreciate the greater need for real and lasting change as a way to provide fulfillment for all citizens.
