         <text><![CDATA[
		 	<p>The Vikings surged out of Scandinavia in the ninth century and attacked areas in Russia, the British Isles, northern France, and the Mediterranean. With their shallow-draft longships, square sails, and powerful oars, the Vikings were able to stealthily make their way up shallow waterways. Vikings coordinated their ships' movements and timed their attacks to take advantage of the tides. Fleets of Viking longships with ferocious dragon heads carved on their prows could sail up a river, surprise a village or monastery far from the sea, and spill out crews of warriors who conducted lightning raids on unprepared victims.</p>
			<p>From the monasteries and towns, Vikings seized golden vessels, coins, and other moveable wealth such as tapestries, glassware, and even farm animals. Thousands of young Viking men chose to take to the seas as a way to gain their fortunes.</p>
			<p>Sometimes Viking fleets attacked larger cities. In 855 C.E., for example, a Viking force of at least 700 longships sailed up the Seine River and besieged Paris. In 994, more than 100 longships sprinted up the Thames River and raided London. Even mighty Constantinople was raided at least three times during the ninth and tenth centuries. Many regions in Europe were politically unstable during this period, and they struggled to defeat the Vikings and other raiders who besieged various parts of the continent.</p>

         <text><![CDATA[
		 	<p>In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, pirates of European descent, also known as buccaneers, looted and plundered throughout the Western and Eastern Hemispheres. Buccaneers used technological advances of the time, such as new types of lateen sails, improved gunpowder weapons, the astrolabe, the compass, a more accurate understanding of ocean currents and prevailing winds, and improved maps.</p>
			<p>From the Caribbean to western South America, pirates disrupted international trade routes by using stealth and occasionally large fleets to seize treasure from the Americasâ€”primarily bars of gold and silver. Pirate fleets in the Caribbean also besieged Spanish ports like Porto Bello in Panama, Cartagena in Colombia, and Havana in Cuba in an effort to seize silver from the mines.</p>
			<p>Pirates lived brutal, often short lives. Their greatest successes came when European powers and various Asian states were distracted fighting each other. When those nations turned their attention to the buccaneers, pirate lairs in the Caribbean were systematically seized and their inhabitants slaughtered.</p>

         <text><![CDATA[
		 	<p>The International Maritime Organization (IMO) reports that pirate attacks have continued to increase worldwide, with the Horn of Africa remaining the most dangerous area for shipping. Other dangerous areas include the coastal waters of Indonesia, the South China Sea, Bangladesh, and Nigeria.</p>
			<p>The most infamous modern pirates are based in war-torn Somalia. Thousands of impoverished young men band together to seek wealth and seize everything from small, privately owned cruisers to huge oil tankers in the Arabian Sea and Indian Ocean. Using GPS, speedboats, rocket-propelled grenades, and automatic rifles, Somali pirates take captains by surprise and seize huge vessels, which often are so automated that their crews are small in number. The pirates have stolen cargoes of food, manufactured goods, and oil shipments. They also take hostages, and then demand millions of dollars in ransom.</p>
			<p>Alarmed by the sharp increase in Somali piracy, a number of nations have sent naval vessels to stop pirate attacks. Modern technology and the use of armed security forces on some vessels have begun to deter pirate attacks.</p>

         <text><![CDATA[
		 	<p>When Christopher Columbus landed in the Americas and established a colony for Spain, he took the first step in creating an immense trade network. The Columbian Exchangeâ€”the global diffusion of plants, food crops, animals, human populations, and disease that took place after the voyages of exploration by Columbus and other European marinersâ€”had consequences much more profound than did earlier rounds of biological exchange. Unlike the earlier processes, the Columbian Exchange involved lands with radically different flora, fauna, and diseases. For thousands of years, the various species of the Eastern Hemisphere, the Western Hemisphere, and Oceania had evolved along separate lines. By creating links between these biological zones, the European voyages of exploration set off a round of biological exchange that permanently altered the world's human geography and natural environment.</p>
