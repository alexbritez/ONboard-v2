			<popTitle>Waitress Uniform </popTitle>
			<popInfo><![CDATA[The waitress uniform looks like it belongs in the 1950s or 1960s. Perhaps this element of the visual is meant to make us compare modern eating habits to habits from years past. The nostalgia brings to mind a simpler time with hearty—albeit unhealthy—<br/>eating habits.]]></popInfo>
