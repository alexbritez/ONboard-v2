			<Text><![CDATA[<p>The stack of note cards kept getting higher and higher. And as it grew, so did Rosa Cartozzi's sense of frustration. For her biology class, Rosa had described the functions of the major organs of the human body on separate note cards, hoping that would help her to memorize them. But all that was happening was that the number of cards was increasing each week.</p>
<p>Rosa decided additional measures were called for. She began to take her stack of cards with her everywhere she went. Whenever she had a spare moment, she would shuffle through the cards, trying to memorize them. She sometimes felt a little silly walking around with her thick stack of cards. But as she spent more time going over them, she became more confident, and she began to recall more and more.</p>
<p>It worked! By the final, Rosa realized that she had succeeded in memorizing most of the information on the cards. She ended the semester with an A in the course.</p>]]></Text>
