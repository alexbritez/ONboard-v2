		<mainText><![CDATA[Political power is that power, which every man having in the state of nature, has given up into the hands of the society, and therein to the governors, whom the society hath set over itself, <br/><br/>So that the end and measure of this power, . . . when in the hands of the magistrate, but to preserve the members of that society in their lives, liberties, and possessions; and so cannot be an absolute, arbitrary power over their lives and fortunes, which are as much as possible to be preserved; but a power to make laws, and annex such penalties to them, as may tend to the preservation of the whole.<br/><br/>. . . These are the bounds which the trust, that is put in them by the society, and the law of God and nature, have set to the legislative power of every commonwealth, in all forms of government.<br/><br/>First, They are to govern by promulgated established laws, not to be varied in particular cases, but to have one rule for rich and poor, for the favourite at court, and the country man at plough.<br/><br/>Secondly, These laws also ought to be designed for no other end ultimately, but the good of the people.<br/><br/>Thirdly, They must not raise taxes on the property of the people, without the consent of the people.]]></mainText>
