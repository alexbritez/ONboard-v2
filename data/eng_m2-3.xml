The school was old, the halls were narrow and dark, but the classroom Mrs. Andrews inhabited was bright and inviting. Standing next to battleship gray lockers and old flyers for events that had ceased to be relevant months before, Mrs. Andrews always greeted her students before the bell rang. Inside her classroom, the cheery yellow walls were peppered with students’ works. Photographs of both new and former students created smiling collages on bulletin boards. I spent the entire first semester hoping one of my essays would make it to the wall with “great job!” or “love this!” scrawled at the top of my page. When two of my assignments appeared on the wall of honor in one week, I knew that I could be a writer. ]]></text></content><audio>eng_m2-3_s11</audio><credits><![CDATA[(tr)C Squared Studios/Getty Images; (bkgd)Grant Faint/Photographer's Choice/Getty Images.]]></credits></scene><scene id="12" type="Fill_In_Blank"><content><header><![CDATA[<p></p>]]></header><text><![CDATA[]]></text><correctText><![CDATA[<p><font face='c-Bold'>Check your description mode:</font>

First, heroes admire hard work and have high expectations. Second, they understand that helping others does not diminish their own power. Third, heroes value commitment and learning. Dreaming big dreams for themselves and for those around them is the fourth step to becoming a hero. Fifth, heroes do not give up, and they do not let others give up. The sixth and final step is this: heroes face challenges or crises without pausing to think about receiving praise or a reward. Ironically, most heroes do not know that they are heroes. ]]></text></content><audio>eng_m2-3_s20</audio><credits><![CDATA[(tr)C Squared Studios/Getty Images; (bkgd)Grant Faint/Photographer's Choice/Getty Images.]]></credits></scene><scene id="21" type="2_Txt_Img_Animation"><video>eng_m2-3_s21</video><credits><![CDATA[(tr)C Squared Studios/Getty Images; (l r)©Pixtal/age Fotostock; (bkgd)Grant Faint/Photographer's      Choice/Getty Images.]]></credits></scene><scene id="22" type="2_Txt_Img_Animation"><video>eng_m2-3_s22</video><credits><![CDATA[(tr)C Squared Studios/Getty Images; (bkgd)Grant Faint/Photographer's Choice/Getty Images.]]></credits></scene><scene id="23" type="3_txt_img_reading"><content><header><![CDATA[Compare and Contrast Paragraph]]></header><text><![CDATA[Heroes often emerge in response to situations they never expected to encounter. In April 2011, tornadoes slammed Alabama, killing almost 300 people across the state. Survivors responded in one of two ways—by helping those around them, or by taking advantage of a terrible situation. The vast majority of people pitched in to help their neighbors by sharing food and gasoline and finding medical supplies for those in need. In contrast, looters also immediately emerged, robbing local businesses in the midst of an unprecedented crisis. The common citizen was presented with an opportunity to be a hero, and the vast majority of those in Alabama proved their valor.]]></text></content><audio>eng_m2-3_s23</audio><credits><![CDATA[(tr)C Squared Studios/Getty Images; (bkgd)Grant Faint/Photographer's Choice/Getty Images.]]></credits></scene><scene id="24" type="2_Txt_Img_Animation"><video>eng_m2-3_s24</video><credits><![CDATA[(tr)C Squared Studios/Getty Images; (c)©Brand X Pictures/PunchStock; (bkgd)Grant Faint/Photographer's      Choice/Getty Images.]]></credits></scene><scene id="25" type="2_Txt_Img_Animation"><video>eng_m2-3_s25</video><credits><![CDATA[(tr bc)C Squared Studios/Getty Images; (br)Don Farrall/Digital Vision/Getty Images; (bkgd)Grant      Faint/Photographer's Choice/Getty Images.]]></credits></scene><scene id="26" type="3_txt_img_reading"><content><header><![CDATA[Cause and Effect Paragraph]]></header><text><![CDATA[Tragedy yields heroism. When the Twin Towers fell during the attack on 9/11, early preparation was the key to saving thousands of lives. Rick Rescorla, a retired Army Colonel, was serving as the director of security at Morgan Stanley at the time of the attacks. He took his job seriously and had intermittently required all staff to follow an evacuation plan he had developed. Due to his careful planning and his order for staff to immediately evacuate the building, more than 2,500 lives were saved.
