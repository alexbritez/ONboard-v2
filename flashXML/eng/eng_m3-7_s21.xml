			<Text><![CDATA[<p><font face='c-Bold'>Source A</font>
—From an address by J. Elizabeth Jones, <font face='lc-Italic'>The Salem, Ohio, 1850 Women’s Rights Convention Proceedings</font>		
“There is not, perhaps, in the wide field of reform, any one subject so difficult to discuss as that of Woman’s Rights. I use the term “Woman’s Rights” because it is a technical phrase. I like not the expression. It is not Woman’s <font face='lc-Italic'>Rights</font> of which I design to speak, but of Woman’s <font face='lc-Italic'>Wrongs</font>. I shall claim nothing for ourselves because of our sex—I shall demand the recognition of no rights on the ground of our womanhood. In the contest which is now being waged in behalf of the enslaved colored man in this land, I have yet to hear the first word in favor of his rights as a colored man; the great point which is sought to be established is this, that the colored man is a human being, and as such, entitled to the free exercise of all the rights which belong to humanity. And we should demand <font face='c-Italic'>our</font> recognition as equal members of the human family. . . .”			
			
<font face='c-Bold'>Source B</font>
—From Mary Wollstonecraft's <font face='lc-Italic'>Vindication of the Rights of Women</font>, 1792. Wollstonecraft was a British philosopher and activist. She believed women were not inferior to men, but only lacking in education.</br>		
“To render mankind more virtuous, and happier of course, both sexes must act from the same principle; but how can that be expected when only one is allowed to see the reasonableness of it? To render also the social compact truly equitable, and in order to spread those enlightening principles, which alone can meliorate the fate of man, women must be allowed to found their virtue on knowledge, which is scarcely possible unless they be educated by the same pursuits as men. For they are now made so inferiour by ignorance and low desires, as not to deserve to be ranked with them; or, by the serpentine wrigglings of cunning they mount the tree of knowledge and only acquire sufficient to lead men astray.”</p>]]></Text>
