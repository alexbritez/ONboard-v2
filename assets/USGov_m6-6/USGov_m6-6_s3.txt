Linda Brown

Linda Brown, an African American teenager, applied for admission to an all-white public school in Topeka, Kansas. The Board of Education of Topeka refused to admit her. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) saw Linda Brown’s situation and that of other young African Americans as an opportunity to challenge segregation.
