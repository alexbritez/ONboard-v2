The sentence begins by claiming that it will define which sport is the most interesting sport to watch. However, “baseball players” are not a sport. They are <font face='lc-Bold'>participants</font> in a sport. To make the sentence logical, we simply have to remove the word “players.” 
This new sentence is completely logical: I think the most interesting sport to watch is baseball.
