        <text>
            <![CDATA[
            <p>
          Your &quot;harmless&quot; habits working long hours, gobbling meals, losing sleep—could be making you sick. Chances are, you could probably name a few bad habits you’d like to break. But did you know that some of your daily indiscretions might be adding up to physical health problems, not to mention causing you psychological stress?  If you repeatedly engage in any of the following high-stress behaviors, let us clue you in to their not-so-healthy effects before you reach the breaking point:
		  </p>

		  <p>You don’t snooze, you lose. &quot;Sleep lets the body’s various systems repair themselves,&quot; says Robert Bulgarelli, D.O., an osteopathic cardiologist in Pennsylvania. When you skimp on slumber, your body is depleted of what it needs to function smoothly. You’re less alert, thus more prone to accidents, and irritable, which leads to lower tolerance for daily stress. Immune function decreases, making you more prone to colds and illness; even fertility can be impaired.
		  </p>

		  <p>Most people who eat on the run tend to grab fat and calorie-laden fast foods. Eating rapidly also leads to overeating, since your body doesn’t have time to register that it’s full. In the long term, rushing meals may lead to weight gain and obesity, which, in turn, may be associated with heart and vascular disease, says Melissa Stoppler, M. D., a stress-management consultant at About.com. In the immediate sense, eating too fast can cause choking, since you don’t take time to chew food thoroughly, and gas, from gulping air along with food. If you eat without chewing sufficiently, your digestive and hormonal systems aren’t prepared for the food and the body doesn’t absorb nutrients as well.
		  </p>

		  <p>It’s great to be helpful to family and co-workers, but when you accommodate all requests, something has to give, and that something is your body. &quot;When you overload yourself with responsibilities, the stress response kicks in,&quot; Kaufmann explains. &quot;Your heart rate and blood pressure rise and adrenaline is activated.&quot; Designed to provide a temporary boost during times of danger, the stress response is not meant to be activated regularly. It can lead to a host of maladies, including tension headaches, irritability, fatigue, digestion problems and heart arrhythmias. You also deplete your energy reserves, which leads to physical and mental exhaustion.
