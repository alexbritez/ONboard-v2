The school was old, the halls were narrow and dark, but the classroom Mrs. Andrews inhabited was bright and inviting. Standing next to battleship gray lockers and old flyers for events that had ceased to be relevant months before, Mrs. Andrews always greeted her students before the bell rang. Inside her classroom, the cheery yellow walls were peppered with students’ works. Photographs of both new and former students created smiling collages on bulletin boards.
