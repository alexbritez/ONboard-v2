			<p>The unlearned part of classical conditioning is based on the fact that some stimuli automatically produce certain responses apart from any prior learning; in other words, they are inborn (innate).</p>
			<p><em>Reflexes</em> are such automatic stimulus–response connections. They include salivation in response to food, nausea in response to spoiled food, shivering in response to low temperature, coughing in response to throat congestion, pupil constriction in response to light, and withdrawal in response to pain.</p>

        <text>
            <![CDATA[
            <p>American linguist Noam Chomsky (1975) has argued that humans come into the world biologically prewired to learn language at a certain time and in a certain way. According to Chomsky and many other language experts, the strongest evidence for language's biological basis is the fact that children all over the world reach language milestones at about the same time and in about the same order, despite vast variations in the language input they receive from their environment. For example, in some cultures, such as some Samoan tribes (Schieffelin & Ochs, 1986), parents snuggle their babies but rarely talk to infants under 1 year of age, yet these infants still acquire language (Sterponi, 2010).</p>
			<p>Using brain-imaging techniques such as PET scans, researchers have found that when an infant is about 9 months old, the hippocampus, the part of the brain that stores and indexes many kinds of memory, becomes fully functional (Bauer, 2009). This is also the time at which infants appear to be able to attach meaning to words, for instance to look at the ball if someone says "ball"—suggesting links among language, cognition, and the development of the brain.</p>
			<p>Decades ago, behaviorists opposed Chomsky's hypothesis and argued that language represents nothing more than chains of responses acquired through reinforcement (Skinner, 1957). A baby happens to babble "ma-ma," mama rewards the baby with hugs and smiles, the baby says "mama" more and more. Bit by bit, said the behaviorists, the baby's language is built up. According to behaviorists, language is a complex learned skill, much like playing the piano or dancing.</p>
			<p>Such a view of language development is simply not tenable, however, given the rapid way children learn language, as well as the lack of evidence that social environments carefully reinforce language skills (R. Brown, 1973). This is not to say the environment has no role in language development. Many language experts argue that a child's experiences, the particular language to be learned, and the context in which learning takes place can strongly influence language acquisition (Berko Gleason, 2009; Goldfield & Snow, 2009).</p>
			<p>In [one] study, researchers observed the language environments of children from two different backgrounds: middle-income professional families and welfare families (Hart & Risley, 1995; Risley & Hart, 2006). Then they examined the children's language development. All of the children developed normally in terms of learning to talk and acquiring the basic rules of English and a fundamental vocabulary. However, the researchers found enormous differences in the sheer amount of language to which the children were exposed and in the level of the children's language development. For example, in a typical hour, the middle-income professional parents spent almost twice as much time communicating with their children as did the welfare parents. The children from the middle-income professional families heard about 2,100 words an hour; their child counterparts in welfare families, only 600 words an hour. The researchers estimated that by 4 years of age, the average welfare-family child would have 13 million fewer words of cumulative language experience than the child in the average middle-income professional family. Amazingly, some of the 3-year-old children from middle-class professional families had a recorded vocabulary that exceeded the recorded vocabulary of some of the welfare parents.</p>

            <![CDATA[
            <p>Imagine that you and your date are enjoying a picnic in the country. Suddenly, a bull runs across the field toward you. Why are you afraid? Two well-known theories of emotion that involve physiological processes provide answers to this question.</p>
			<p>Common sense tells you that you are trembling and running away from the bull because you are afraid, but William James (1950) and Carl Lange (1922) said emotion works in the opposite way. According to the James-Lange theory, emotion results from physiological states triggered by stimuli in the environment: Emotion occurs after physiological reactions. Moreover, each emotion – from anger to rapture –has a distinct set of physiological changes, evident in changes in hear rate, breathing patterns, sweating, and other responses. Essentially, the James-Lange theory proposes that after the initial perception, the experience of emotion results from the perception of one's own physiological changes.</p>
			<p>Let's see how the James-Lange theory would explain fear in the situation with the bull. You see the bull scratching its hoof on the ground, and you begin to run away. Your aroused body then sends sensory messages to your brain, at which point emotion is perceived. According to this theory, you do not run away because you are afraid; rather you are afraid because you are running away.</p>

        <text>
            <![CDATA[
            <p>Consider the following cases:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>William J. Whitfield, 22, shot to death in a supermarket in 1997 while holding his car keys.</li>
				<li>Julian Alexander, a 20-year-old newlywed, killed in front of his home in 2008 while holding a wooden stick he was using to fix curtains. </li>
			</ul>
<p>In both of these instances, the victims were Black men, shot by police officers who mistook the harmless object they were holding for a weapon. In those cases in which investigators have completed, the police officers were cleared of wrongdoing. Juries and judges concluded that they had made terrible but honest mistakes. These and similar cases have incited public interest. What role did race play in these &quot;honest&quot; perceptual mistakes?</p>
<p>Social psychologist Keith Payne examined how race affects the tendency to misperceive harmless objects as handguns (Payne, 2001, 2010; Stokes &amp; Payne, 2010). Participants were told that they would see two pictures on a computer screen. Their job was to decide, very quickly, whether the second picture was a gun or a tool. The first picture—always a picture of an African American man or a White man—cued the participants that the judgment was coming. Participants were more likely to misperceive tools as guns when the tools were shown after a picture of an African American man.</p>

            <p>American linguist Noam Chomsky (1975) has argued that humans come into the world biologically prewired to learn language at a certain time and in a certain way. According to Chomsky and many other language experts, the strongest evidence for language's biological basis is the fact that children all over the world reach language milestones at about the same time and in about the same order, despite vast variations in the language input they receive from their environment. For example, in some cultures, such as some Samoan tribes (Schieffelin & Ochs, 1986), parents snuggle their babies but rarely talk to infants under 1 year of age, yet these infants still acquire language (Sterponi, 2010).</p>
			<p>Decades ago, behaviorists opposed Chomsky's hypothesis and argued that language represents nothing more than chains of responses acquired through reinforcement (Skinner, 1957). A baby happens to babble "ma-ma," mama rewards the baby with hugs and smiles, the baby says "mama" more and more. Bit by bit, said the behaviorists, the baby's language is built up. According to behaviorists, language is a complex learned skill, much like playing the piano or dancing.</p>
