		<mainText><![CDATA[<p>The Schism essentially resulted from a deep divide between the French and the Italians in the College of Cardinals. The outcome of the electoral squabble in 1378 produced two popes: one in Rome and a second pope in Avignon (in the south of France).<br /><br />The actions of these rival claimants to the throne of St. Peter were observed in horror and bewilderment by pious Christians across Europe.  Both leaders denounced the other as false pope, each ex-communicated the other and both portrayed their opposite as the anti-Christ.<br /><br />This religious divide in the Church served to further deepen the political divide in Europe.  The French naturally supported the Avignon Pope. The English, at war against France, recognized the Pope in Rome. The Scots, rebelling against English authority, backed the Avignon Pope, and so on.<br /><br />The Avignon Schism was resolved by 1414, but the damage was done.  This period of appalling leadership at the very top, coupled with the loss of so many good clergymen due to the plague, enabled Luther’s successful challenge to the Church’s role at the start of modern times—paving the way for the Protestant Reformation.</p>]]></mainText>
