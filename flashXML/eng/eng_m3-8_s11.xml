		<qText><![CDATA[<p>A concept that has been evolving with scientific advances over the past decade is that drug addiction is a brain disease that develops over time as a result of the initial voluntary behavior of using drugs. A <font face='c-Italic'>disease</font>  is defined as the “condition of the living animal or plant body that impairs normal functioning.” Interestingly, <font face='c-Italic'>disease</font>  is also defined as a “harmful development, as in a social institution.” The consequence of this brain disease is virtually uncontrollable drug craving and use that interferes with, if not destroys, an individual's functioning in the family and in society. This medical condition demands formal treatment.</p>]]></qText>
