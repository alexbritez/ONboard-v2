		<mainText>Heroes are not born that way; they become remarkable in many cases by successfully following these steps to become a hero. First, heroes admire hard work and have high expectations. Second, they understand that helping others does not diminish their own power. Third, heroes value commitment and learning. Dreaming big dreams for themselves and for those around them is the fourth step to becoming a hero. Fifth, heroes do not give up, and they do not let others give up. The sixth and final step is this: heroes face challenges or crises without pausing to think about receiving praise or a reward. Ironically, most heroes do not know that they are heroes. </mainText>
