		<mainText><![CDATA[<p>Workers' demoralizing dependence on their employers was another characteristic feature of the industrial age. Most new factories employed between 150 and 300 men, women, and children whose well-being was largely tied to a single employer. A high proportion of these people, new to the area in which they lived, depended on cash to pay their rent, to purchase rough cotton clothes, to provide the bread that was the staple of their diet, and to buy some candles and coal. For most workers employment was never steady. It was common for a third of the adult males of a town to be without work, especially in winter, and pauperism was acknowledged to be the social disease of the [nineteenth] century, a condition that included some 10 percent of the population in Britain and only slightly less in France. 
Workers were the people hit hardest by the periodic economic depressions that baffled even the most optimistic observers. The depression of 1846 was nearly universal, and that of 1857 extended from North America to eastern Europe. When Britain lost access to American cotton during the Civil War of the 1860s, layoffs in the Lancashire cotton industry ran so high that at one point over 250,000 workers, more than half the total, lived on relief. Recipes for watery soup handed out by the charitable agencies of every city defined the thinness of survival.
