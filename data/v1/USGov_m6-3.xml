			<strong>Third Parties</strong>
		</p>
        <p style="font-size:80%">
			Minor or third parties rarely win major elections in the United States. Why is this the case?
        </p>
		<p style="font-size:80%">
			For one thing, the United States' <a href="#" data-id="0" class="hotspot"><strong>electoral system</strong></a>—which is made up of <a href="#" data-id="1" class="hotspot"><strong>single-member districts</strong></a>—makes it difficult for third parties to compete. Also, American politics has traditionally been characterized by compromise and negotiation between the two major parties, which allows their candidates to appeal to more voters.
		</p>
		<p style="font-size:80%">
			Some third parties form over a single issue, such as slavery. Some have formed over a political figure, such as Theodore Roosevelt's Bull Moose Progressive Party. Others form over an <a href="#" data-id="2" class="hotspot"><strong>ideology</strong></a>, like the Communist Party USA or, more recently, the Tea Party—a conservative party that promotes less government, fiscal responsibility, and states' rights. Although third parties might not have a strong chance of winning, they often influence politics by promoting new ideas.

      <text>
        <![CDATA[
		<p>
			The mass media includes print media and broadcast media. The Internet has emerged as a powerful new interactive medium. The relationship between the media and U.S. government officials is complex. They need to work together, but their jobs often place them in adversarial positions.
		</p>
        <p>
			The president and television have a mutually beneficial relationship. The president is a great source of news, and television offers presidents the best way to "sell" their ideas and policies to the public. White House staff media advisers control the daily flow of information through news releases and briefings, press conferences, background stories, leaks, and media events.
        </p>
		<p>
			Congress gets less media coverage than the president because most legislative work takes place in committees and subcommittees over long periods of time. When Congress is in the news, reporters tend to focus on controversial issues such as confirmation hearings, oversight activities, or the personal lives of members. C-SPAN broadcasts floor proceedings of the House and Senate.
        </p>
		<p>
			During election season, television greatly influences who runs for office, how candidates are nominated, and campaign advertising. Television lets candidates appeal directly to the people. TV ads also allow candidates to make their opponents look unappealing.
