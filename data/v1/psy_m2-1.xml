			<p>Why Study Psychology?</p>
            <p>
          I decided to study psychology because I am interested in human behavior. I have always been fascinated by why people do the things they do. For example, why do some people join religious cults? What compels people to show compassion to others? In what circumstances do people not show compassion?</p>
<p>Studying psychology has helped me answer those questions and has given me a glimpse into the human mind.

          It’s difficult to describe my attitude after I had taken a few psychology classes. A friend would start talking about her ex-boyfriend and instead of agreeing with her, I began to wonder about her motivations. I started observing the behavior of groups at parties. I began to understand why some members of the group went along with the others even though they were clearly uncomfortable. I was more thoughtful about human behavior than ever before. I felt as though I had an insight into their behavior. Personally, I was much more self-aware.

          <strong>Long-term memory</strong> is a relatively permanent type of memory that stores huge amounts of information for a long time. The capacity of long-term memory is staggering. John von Neumann, a distinguished mathematician, put the size at 2.8 &middot; 10<sup>20</sup> (280 quintillion) bits, which in practical terms means that our storage capacity is virtually unlimited. Von Neumann assumed that we never forget anything; but even considering that we do forget things, we can hold several billion times more information than a large computer.

          Humans are selfish. It’s so easy to say. The same goes for so many assertions that follow. Greed is good. Altruism is an illusion. Cooperation is for suckers. Competition is natural, war inevitable. The bad in human nature is stronger than the good….

			<p>Recent studies of compassion argue persuasively for a different take on human nature, one that rejects the preeminence of self-interest.
			</p>
			<p>…Compassion and benevolence, this research suggests, are an evolved part of human nature, rooted in our brain and biology, and ready to be cultivated for the greater good.

			<p>First consider the recent study of the biological basis of compassion. If such a basis exists, we should be wired up, so to speak, to respond to others in need. Recent evidence supports this point convincingly. University of Wisconsin psychologist Jack Nitschke found in an experiment that when mothers looked at pictures of their babies, they not only reported feeling more compassionate love than when they saw other babies; they also demonstrated unique activity in a region of their brains associated with the positive emotions. Nitschke’s finding suggests that this region of the brain is attuned to the first objects of our compassion—our offspring.
			</p>
			<p>But this compassionate instinct isn’t limited to parents’ brains. In a different set of studies, Joshua Greene and Jonathan Cohen of Princeton University found that when subjects contemplated harm being done to others, a similar network of regions in their brains lit up. Our children and victims of violence—two very different subjects, yet united by the similar neurological reactions they provoke. This consistency strongly suggests that compassion isn’t simply a fickle or irrational emotion, but rather an innate human response embedded into the folds of our brains.

            <p>"Secrets of Happiness" by Steven Reiss</p>
            <p>
          Feel-good happiness is sensation-based pleasure. When we joke around or [eat chocolate], we experience feel-good happiness. Since feel-good happiness is ruled by the law of diminishing returns, the kicks get harder to come by. This type of happiness rarely lasts longer than a few hours at a time. Value-based happiness is a sense that our lives have meaning and fulfill some larger purpose. It represents a spiritual source of satisfaction, stemming from our deeper purpose and values. Since this form of happiness is not ruled by the law of diminishing returns, there is no limit to how meaningful our lives can be.
            </p>
			<p>You cannot find enduring happiness by aiming to have more fun or by seeking pleasure. What you need to do, as the 19th-century philosopher J. S. Mill observed, is to satisfy your basic desires and take happiness in passing. How strongly are you motivated to obtain a successful marriage, career or family? Do you love a good meal and dining out? Must you be physically fit to be happy? …    </p>
			<p>After you identify your most important desires, you need to find effective ways to satisfy them. There is a catch, however. Shortly after you satisfy a desire, it reasserts itself, motivating you to satisfy the desire all over again. After a career success, for example, you feel competent, but only for a period of time. Therefore, you need to satisfy your desires repeatedly.
			<p>How can we repeatedly satisfy our most important basic desires and find value-based happiness? Most people turn to relationships, careers, family, leisure and spirituality to satisfy their most important desires. Since we have the potential to satisfy our basic desires through relationships, we can find greater happiness by finding new relationships or by improving the ones we already have.
			</p>

            <p>
          Feel-good happiness is sensation-based pleasure. When we joke around or [eat chocolate], we experience feel-good happiness. Since feel-good happiness is ruled by the law of diminishing returns, the kicks get harder to come by. This type of happiness rarely lasts longer than a few hours at a time. Value-based happiness is a sense that our lives have meaning and fulfill some larger purpose. It represents a spiritual source of satisfaction, stemming from our deeper purpose and values. Since this form of happiness is not ruled by the law of diminishing returns, there is no limit to how meaningful our lives can be.
	        </p>

			<p>You cannot find enduring happiness by aiming to have more fun or by seeking pleasure. What you need to do, as the 19th-century philosopher J. S. Mill observed, is to satisfy your basic desires and take happiness in passing. How strongly are you motivated to obtain a successful marriage, career or family? Do you love a good meal and dining out? Must you be physically fit to be happy? …
		    </p>

			<p>After you identify your most important desires, you need to find effective ways to satisfy them. There is a catch, however. Shortly after you satisfy a desire, it reasserts itself, motivating you to satisfy the desire all over again. After a career success, for example, you feel competent, but only for a period of time. Therefore, you need to satisfy your desires repeatedly.
			</p>

			<p>How can we repeatedly satisfy our most important basic desires and find value-based happiness? Most people turn to relationships, careers, family, leisure and spirituality to satisfy their most important desires. Since we have the potential to satisfy our basic desires through relationships, we can find greater happiness by finding new relationships or by improving the ones we already have.

    			<p>&quot;Does Gender Influence Language?&quot;</p>
          <p>Common stereotypes suggest that women are the talkative sex. The bestseller <em>The Female Brain</em> by Louann Brizendine (2006) claims that women talk three times as much as men. Brizendine suggests that women's brains are wired from birth to be extraordinarily sensitive for social information. Women, she says, have an &quot;eight-lane superhighway&quot; for processing emotion, whereas men have only &quot;a single country road.&quot;</p>
          <p>The notion that men are somehow missing out on an emotional expressway is also reflected in the <em>extreme male brain theory</em> of autism. Simon Baron-Cohen has suggested that characteristics associated with autism might be considered simply extreme forms of the &quot;male brain&quot;—that is, one that is well suited to math and spatial reasoning but less well geared to verbal and social skills. This controversial notion certainly shows that people seem to be prone to extreme positions and stereotypes when discussing gender differences. </p>
