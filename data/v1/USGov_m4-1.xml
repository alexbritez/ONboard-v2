            <h1>Strategy 1: Pace Yourself</h1>
            <p>The AP Exam has 60 multiple-choice questions. You have 45 minutes to answer all of them. Answer the simpler classic questions first. You should be able to answer three or four classic questions in the amount of time it takes to answer the other kinds of questions. Get the easy ones out of the way, and then go back to tackle the others.</p>

            <h1>Strategy 2: Don't Doubt Yourself</h1>
            <p>If you think you know an answer, go with it. Don't talk yourself into believing that there must be a more complicated answer. If you're spending too much time on a question, circle it and come back to it later. You might find a "hint" in another question that may help you select the correct answer.</p>
