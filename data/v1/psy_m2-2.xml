        <text>
            <![CDATA[
            <p>Consider the following cases:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>William J. Whitfield, 22, shot to death in a supermarket in 1997 while holding his car keys.</li>
				<li>Julian Alexander, a 20-year-old newlywed, killed in front of his home in 2008 while holding a wooden stick he was using to fix curtains. </li>
			</ul>
<p>In both of these instances, the victims were Black men, shot by police officers who mistook the harmless object they were holding for a weapon. In those cases in which investigators have completed, the police officers were cleared of wrongdoing. Juries and judges concluded that they had made terrible but honest mistakes. These and similar cases have incited public interest. What role did race play in these &quot;honest&quot; perceptual mistakes?</p>
<p>Social psychologist Keith Payne examined how race affects the tendency to misperceive harmless objects as handguns (Payne, 2001, 2010; Stokes &amp; Payne, 2010). Participants were told that they would see two pictures on a computer screen. Their job was to decide, very quickly, whether the second picture was a gun or a tool. The first picture—always a picture of an African American man or a White man—cued the participants that the judgment was coming. Participants were more likely to misperceive tools as guns when the tools were shown after a picture of an African American man.</p>

        	<text>
            <![CDATA[
            <p>We've all heard the stereotypes: Firstborns tend to be perfectionists; middle kids, peacemakers; babies, spoiled rotten. But the reality is much more nuanced. Though kids in the same birth position often do share certain character traits, the variables within each family determine the degree to which they fulfill or defy the propensities of birth rank.</p>
			<p>If you're aware of the potential advantages and disadvantages of a child's rank, you can help your kids resist any negative stereotypes.</p>
			<p style="text-align:center;font-size:120%;"><strong>Firstborns: Natural Leaders</strong></p>
			<p><strong>ADVANTAGES:</strong><br/>
			Before any siblings come along, oldest children get the lion's share of parents' attention, says Meri Wallace, author of Birth Order Blues: How Parents Can Help Their Children Meet the Challenges of Birth Order. Mom and Dad have the time to sing songs with them during baths or read them extra books before bed. As only children for a while, they're the first to be the focus of their parents' love and affection and the first to wow the grown-ups by reaching major childhood milestones.</p>
			<p>All that undivided attention can translate into a highly successful individual. "If a parent is there providing encouragement, a child can gain tremendous amounts of self-confidence," says Wallace. …</p>
			<p>And once firstborns become older siblings, they have the opportunity to lead. "The younger child often adores the older one because she can do so many things," says Wallace. This chance to teach and nurture a younger sister or brother further boosts the firstborn's self-esteem. …</p>
			<p><strong>CHALLENGES:</strong><br/>
			The greatest strengths of the firstborn can also become her biggest obstacles. For instance, a child who's a natural leader can have trouble making and keeping friends if she's always bossing them around.</p>
			<p>Firstborns also risk becoming perfectionists because of the scrutiny they're subjected to by doting parents, who, though well-meaning, may focus on tiny flaws, making their child feel inadequate. Even when parents are supportive, firstborns can still put enormous pressure on themselves to succeed.</p>
			<p><strong>HOW YOU CAN HELP:</strong><br/>
			Don't be too domineering. Refrain from correcting minor imperfections. If your child's bedspread is crooked, don't straighten it; if her attempt to style her hair goes awry, leave it be. Brush off mistakes with a "Good try," then move on. And show how you can roll with the punches yourself—accept compliments gracefully, apologize when you've made a mistake, and let your child know when something didn't go as you'd planned. …</p>
			<p style="text-align:center;font-size:120%;"><strong>Second-borns: Innovators</strong></p>
			<p><strong>ADVANTAGES:</strong><br/>
			Kids in the number-two spot have the luxury of more relaxed parents. In part, that's because Mom and Dad are too busy juggling the demands of a growing family to focus as much anxious energy on him as they did the firstborn, or perhaps because they feel more confident about their decisions. Either way, their calmer demeanor tends to transfer to a second child, who'll typically recover from setbacks more easily than his older sibling and be more creative and playful.</p>
			<p>Second-born kids also try to be different just to get noticed by their parents, which can make them real innovators. "The firstborn establishes the theme, and the younger child, to be an individual, develops a variation on the theme," says Wallace. Even if the kids share the same talent, they rarely express that gift in the same way. One child may play the piano, while the other sings in the chorus.</p>
			<p>At the same time, second-borns tend to be more competent than firstborns of the same age because they've worked hard to emulate their older brother or sister and they're more independent—they've had an older sibling to show them the way.</p>
			<p><strong>CHALLENGES:</strong><br/>
			A second child may feel inadequate when he compares himself to his older sister. If Mom and Dad are constantly applauding her accomplishments, he may worry that they love her more. To get attention, he may become a show-off or be extra competitive with other kids.</p>
			<p><strong>HOW YOU CAN HELP:</strong><br/>
			Encourage him to talk about his feelings, giving him words to express himself. … Let him know that you love him for who he is and that he doesn't need to outdo anyone to gain your attention.</p>
			<p>Then be sure to praise him for his own strengths and abilities… If you rejoice in each child's uniqueness, you'll end up with kids who are very different, but each will feel that he's a cherished member of the family.</p>
			<p>If you have a third baby, your second-born, of course, becomes a middle child, a birth position that comes with its own set of potential traits:</p>
			<p style="text-align:center;font-size:120%;"><strong>Middle Kids: Sharp Negotiators</strong></p>
			<p><strong>ADVANTAGES:</strong><br/>
			A child who has both an older and a younger sibling has someone to learn from and someone she can nurture. Like her older sibling, she has the opportunity to be a leader—an experience that will help build her self-confidence. As one of three (or more) kids, she's able to learn how to relate to a group, how to share, listen to others, and join in activities—so she'll probably get along well with others.</p>
			<p><strong>CHALLENGES:</strong><br/>
			When a third child is born, the second's status takes on a new variation: Middle kids may feel left out and overlooked and may be anxious and insecure as a result. If this pattern continues throughout childhood, it can make a child less likely to speak up for herself.</p>
			<p>To get her parent's attention, a middle child may act out. She also has to struggle to maintain her identity; to define herself, she may become obsessed with a hobby or be overly competitive. Some middle children may become people pleasers to win affection, and others will withdraw, especially if their parents are always engaged in battles with the other two kids.</p>
			<p><strong>HOW YOU CAN HELP:</strong><br/>
			Work hard to make a middle child feel special. Try to spend at least some time alone with her every day—and with each of your kids. … Ask her opinion, to help build her confidence.</p>
			<p>Whether it's your second, third, or later child, someone will be the baby, with the quirks that go along with that position:</p>
			<p style="text-align:center;font-size:120%;"><strong>Babies: Free Spirits</strong></p>
			<p><strong>ADVANTAGES:</strong><br/>
			Like the middle child, the youngest benefits from having more relaxed parents and having older siblings to follow. He's also exposed to more than other kids his age because he's watched his brothers and sisters develop and reach milestones, says Wallace. Since he wants to be like them, he'll insist on doing things by himself.</p>
			<p>Sometimes the baby is the most creative, since he has so much time to himself. And he often has fewer responsibilities than his siblings because others always lend him a hand. Babies often become fun-loving, affectionate, and outgoing people.</p>
			<p><strong>CHALLENGES:</strong><br/>
			Because the family may be more lax with the youngest, he may have difficulty respecting authority later on. And since people often take over for him, he may become too dependent on others and struggle with handling his own problems. He may also feel less competent than his older siblings—though he learns from them, they can still do much more than he can.</p>
			<p><strong>HOW YOU CAN HELP:</strong><br/>
			There will be sibling rivalry, but step in if your baby's being bullied—kids need help developing the skills to work it out… Give him responsibilities—even a small task like helping to clear the dishes will be beneficial. Let him hear you remind older siblings that they also used to take longer to put on their coats.</p>
			<p>Birth-order traits often emphasize the differences between siblings, but it's important to remember that they have a lot in common too.</p>

        <text>
            <![CDATA[
            <p>One of the interesting features of your memory system is that you don't control what is stored. Wanting to remember something doesn't have much bearing on whether or not you will actually remember it. Indeed, when you think about it, most of what you remember is not stuff that you consciously tried to store. Your knowledge of current events, of movie plots, of your friends' latest doings—you didn't try to commit any of that to memory. What you did do was think about those things. And here's how you should think about memory: it's the residue of thought, meaning that the more you think about something, the more likely it is that you'll remember it later.</p>
			<p>It can be hard to grasp just how specific, or narrow, your thoughts—and thus your memories—can be, so let's walk through one more example. Suppose you encounter a barking dog while on a walk. There are several aspects of the dog that you could think about. You could think about the sound of the dog's bark, what the dog looked like, or the meaning of the bark (why it's barking, whether it's barking at you, the likelihood that a barking dog will bite, and so on). Each of these thoughts will lead to different memories of the event the next day. If you think about the sound of the dog's bark, the next day you'll probably remember that quite well, but not its appearance. Now, suppose that when you saw the barking dog, you thought mostly about what a nuisance the noise must be to the neighbors. If, the next day, I asked, "Did you see anything on your walk that could bite?" you might well say, "No, I don't think I did." To put this example into broader terms, even simple concepts have multiple aspects of meaning; which one of these you think about will determine what you remember.</p>
			<p>Thus, the first principle for students is that memories are formed as the residue of thought. You remember what you think about, but not every fleeting thought—only those matters to which you really devote some attention.</p>

            <![CDATA[
            <p>How do we know that we know something? If I said to you, "Could you name the first President of the United States?" you would say, "Yes, I could tell you that." On the other hand, if I said, "Could you tell me the names of the two series of novels written by Anthony Trollope?" you might say, "No." What processes go into your judgment of what you know? The answer may at first seem obvious: You look in your memory and see what's there. …</p>
			<p>But, if the mechanism were really so simple, we would seldom--if ever--make mistakes about what we know. In fact, we do make such mistakes. For example, we have all confidently thought that we knew how to get to a destination, but then when put to the test by actually having to drive there, we realize that we don't know. The route may seem familiar, but that's a far cry from recalling every turn and street name.</p>
			<p>The feeling of knowing has an important role in school settings because it is a key determinant of student studying…. Every teacher has seen that students' assessments of their own knowledge are not always accurate. Indeed, this inaccuracy can be a source of significant frustration for students on examinations. The student is certain that he or she has mastered some material, yet performs poorly on a test, and may, therefore, conclude that the test was not fair. The student has assessed his or her knowledge and concluded that it is solid, yet the examination indicates that it is not. What happened? What cues do students use to decide that they know something?</p>
			<p>Cognitive science research has shown that two cues are especially important in guiding our judgments of what we know: (1) our "familiarity" with a given body of information and (2) our "partial access" to that information.</p>
			<p style="text-align:center;font-size:120%;"><strong>"Familiarity" Fools Our Mind into Thinking We Know More than We Do</strong></p>
			<p>The idea of familiarity is, well, familiar to all of us. We have all had the experience of seeing someone and sensing that her face is familiar but being unable to remember who that person is or how we know her.</p>
			<p>Psychologists distinguish between familiarity and recollection. Familiarity is the knowledge of having seen or otherwise experienced some stimulus before, but having little information associated with it in your memory. Recollection, on the other hand, is characterized by richer associations. For example, a young student might be familiar with George Washington (he knows he was a President and maybe that there's a holiday named after him), whereas an older student could probably recollect a substantial narrative about him.</p>
			<p>Although familiarity and recollection are different, an insidious effect of familiarity is that it can give you the feeling that you know something when you really don't. For example, it has been shown that if some key words of a question are familiar, you are more likely to think that you know the answer to the question. In one experiment demonstrating this effect (Reder, 1987), subjects were exposed to a variety of word pairs (e.g. "golf" and "par") and then asked to complete a short task that required them to think at least for a moment about the words. Next, subjects saw a set of trivia questions, some of which used words that the subjects had just been exposed to in the previous task. Subjects were asked to make a rapid judgment as to whether or not they knew the answer to the question--and then they were to provide the answer.</p>
			<p>If the trivia question contained key words from the previous task (e.g., "What term in golf refers to a score of one under par on a particular hole?"), those words should have seemed familiar, and may have led to a feeling of knowing. Indeed, Reder found that subjects were likely to say that they knew the answer to a question containing familiar words, irrespective of whether they could actually answer the question. For questions in which words had not been rendered familiar, subjects were fairly accurate in rapidly assessing their knowledge….</p>
			<p style="text-align:center;font-size:120%;"><strong>"Partial Access": Our Mind Is Fooled When We Know Part of the Material or Related Material</strong></p>
			<p>A second basis for the feeling of knowing is "partial access," which refers to the knowledge that an individual has of either a component of the target material or information closely related to the target material. …</p>
			<p>The effect of partial access was demonstrated in an experiment in which subjects were asked difficult trivia questions. If subjects couldn't answer a particular question, they were asked to judge whether they would recognize the answer if they saw it (i.e., to make a feeling-of-knowing judgment). The interesting twist: Some of the questions used categories for which lots of examples came to mind for their subjects (e.g., composers) and matching questions used categories for which few examples came to mind (e.g., choreographers)--that is, these subjects could easily think of at least a few famous composers, but couldn't think of more than one or two choreographers, if any.</p>
			<p>The results showed that whether or not they could actually recognize the right answer, people gave higher feeling-of-knowing judgments to questions using many-example categories (e.g., "Who composed the music for the ballet Swan Lake?") than to questions using few-example categories (e.g., "Who choreographed the ballet Swan Lake?"). The experimenters argued that when people see the composer question, the answer doesn't come to mind, but the names of several composers do. This related information leads to a feeling of knowing.</p>
			<p>These studies, and dozens of others like them, confirm two general principles of how people gauge their memories. First, people do not assess their knowledge directly by inspecting the contents of memory. Rather, they use cues such as familiarity and partial access. Second, most of the time these cues provide a reasonable assessment of knowledge, but they are fallible.</p>

        	<text>
            <![CDATA[
            <p>If a student believes that he knows material, he will likely divert attention elsewhere; he will stop listening, reading, working, or participating. Mentally "checking out" is never a good choice for students, but all the more so when they disengage because they think they know material that, in fact, they do not know. The feeling of knowing becomes a problem if you have the feeling without the knowing. There are some very obvious ways in which students can reach this unfortunate situation in a school setting. Here are several common ones:</p>
			<p><strong>1. Rereading.</strong> To prepare for an examination, a student rereads her class notes and textbook. Along the way, she encounters familiar terms ("familiar" as in she knows she's heard these terms before), and indeed they become even more familiar to her as she rereads. She thinks, "Yes, I've seen this, I know this, I understand this." But feeling that you understand material as it is presented to you is not the same as being able to recount it yourself.</p>
			<p>As teachers know, this gap between feeling that you know and genuine recollection can cause great frustration. I have frequently had exchanges in which one of my students protests that despite a low test grade, he or she really knew the material. When I ask a general question or two, the student struggles to answer and ends up sputtering, "I can't exactly explain it, but I know it!" Invariably, a student with this problem has spent a great deal of time reading over the course material, yielding a lot of familiarity, but not the necessary and richer recollective knowledge.</p>
			<p><strong>2. Shallow Processing.</strong>  A teacher may prepare an excellent lesson containing a good deal of deep meaning. But this deep meaning will only reside in a student's memory if the student has actively thought about that deep meaning. Let's say, for example, that a teacher has prepared a lesson on the European settlement of Australia and on the meaningful issue of whether that settlement should be viewed as a colonization or invasion. But, let's say that a given student did not process and retain the deep meaning intended by the lesson. He did absorb key terms like "Captain Cook" and "Aborigines." His familiarity with these key terms could mislead him into believing he was ready for a test on the subject.</p>
			<p><strong>3. Recollecting Related Information.</strong> Sometimes students know a lot of information related to the target topic, and that makes them feel as though they know the target information. (This is analogous to the subjects in the experiment who knew the names of many composers and so felt that they knew who composed Swan Lake.) Suppose that a fifth-grade class spent three weeks studying weather systems, including studying weather maps, collecting local data, keeping a weather journal, learning about catastrophic weather events like hurricanes, and so on. In preparation for a test, the teacher says that there will be a question on how meteorologists use weather maps to predict hurricanes. When the student hears "weather map," she might recall such superficial information as that they are color coded, that they include temperature information, and so on; she feels she knows about weather maps and doesn't study further. In fact, she hasn't yet come to understand the core issue--how weather maps are used to predict weather. But her general familiarity with the maps has tricked her into believing she had the necessary knowledge when she didn't. (Ironically, the problem of recollecting related information is most likely to occur when a student has mastered a good deal of material on the general topic; that is, he's mastered related material, but not the target material. It's the knowledge of the related material that creates the feeling of knowing.)</p>
			<p>Cognitive science research confirms teachers' impressions that students do not always know what they think they know. It also shows where this false sense of knowledge comes from and helps us imagine the kinds of teaching and learning activities that could minimize this problem. In particular, teachers can help students test their own knowledge in ways that provide more accurate assessments of what they really know--which enables students to better judge when they have mastered material and when (and where) more work is required.</p>

Recollecting Related Information.</strong> Sometimes students know a lot of information related to the target topic, and that makes them feel as though they know the target information. (This is analogous to the subjects in the experiment who knew the names of many composers and so felt that they knew who composed Swan Lake.) Suppose that a fifth-grade class spent three weeks studying weather systems, including studying weather maps, collecting local data, keeping a weather journal, learning about catastrophic weather events like hurricanes, and so on. In preparation for a test, the teacher says that there will be a question on how meteorologists use weather maps to predict hurricanes. When the student hears "weather map," she might recall such superficial information as that they are color coded, that they include temperature information, and so on; she feels she knows about weather maps and doesn't study further. In fact, she hasn't yet come to understand the core issue--how weather maps are used to predict weather. But her general familiarity with the maps has tricked her into believing she had the necessary knowledge when she didn't. (Ironically, the problem of recollecting related information is most likely to occur when a student has mastered a good deal of material on the general topic; that is, he's mastered related material, but not the target material. It's the knowledge of the related material that creates the feeling of knowing.)</p>
			<p>Cognitive science research confirms teachers' impressions that students do not always know what they think they know. It also shows where this false sense of knowledge comes from and helps us imagine the kinds of teaching and learning activities that could minimize this problem. In particular, teachers can help students test their own knowledge in ways that provide more accurate assessments of what they really know--which enables students to better judge when they have mastered material and when (and where) more work is required.</p>
