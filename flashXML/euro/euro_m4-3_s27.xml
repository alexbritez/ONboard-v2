		<mainText><![CDATA[<p>Although the [American Revolution] stirred sympathy and interest [in Europe], it seemed remote from the realities of Europe. The French Revolution of 1789 proved to be the turning point in European history. Its sheer radicalism, creativity, and claims of universalism made it unique. Its ultimate slogan—“Liberty, Equality, Fraternity”—expressed social and civic ideals that became the foundations of modern Western civilization. In the name of individual liberty, French revolutionaries swept away the institutionalized constraints of the old regime: seigneurial charges upon the land, tax privileges, guild monopolies on commerce, and even (in 1794) black slavery overseas. The revolutionaries held that legitimate governments required written constitutions, elections, and powerful legislatures. They demanded equality before the law for all persons and uniformity of institutions for all regions of the country, denying the claims to special treatment of privileged groups, provinces, towns, or religions. The term fraternity expressed a different kind of revolutionary goal… It meant that all citizens, regardless of social class, or region, shared a common fate in society and that the nation’s well-being could override the interests of individual citizens.
