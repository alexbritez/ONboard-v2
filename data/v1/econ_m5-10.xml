				<h1>&quot;Great Leap Forward&quot;</h1>
				<p>The &quot;Great Leap Forward&quot; in Communist China occurred in the late 1950s–early 1960s. Real per capita GDP declined, however. Private property rights were not protected as the Communist government ordered the creation of farming communes and backyard factories. Russia stopped sharing new technology, and bad weather hurt farming.</p>

				<h1>The Cultural Revolution</h1>
				<p>During China's Cultural Revolution of the 1960s–1970s, the per capita GDP continued to stagnate and, in some years, decline. Engineers, scientists, and other professionals were removed and sent to the countryside. Trucks and trains were taken for military purposes. Politicians, not professional managers, ran firms.</p>

				<h1>Reform</h1>
				<p style="font-size:83%">Since 1979, China's economy has grown by nearly 10% per year. That year, Deng Xiaoping rose to power and began implementing economic reforms. He reintroduced private property for farming, lifted the ban on private enterprise, opened the nation to foreign investment, and focused on education and training. China's leaders have used many of the economic strategies for growth to attain their &quot;Chinese Miracle.&quot;</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>&quot;Calls for more aid to Africa are growing louder, with advocates pushing for doubling the roughly $50 billion of international assistance that already goes to Africa each year.
		         </p>
				 <p>Yet evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that aid to Africa has made the poor poorer, and the growth slower. The insidious aid culture has left African countries more debt-laden, more inflation-prone, more vulnerable to the vagaries of the currency markets and more unattractive to higher-quality investment. . . .
				 </p>
				 <p>Stuck in an aid world of no incentives, there is no reason for governments to seek other, better, more transparent ways of raising development finance (such as accessing the bond market, despite how hard that might be). The aid system encourages poor-country governments to pick up the phone and ask the donor agencies for the next capital infusion. It is no wonder that across Africa, over 70% of the public purse comes from foreign aid. . . .
				 </p>
				 <p>. . . The good news is we know what works; what delivers growth and reduces poverty. We know that economies that rely on open-ended commitments of aid almost universally fail, and those that do not depend on aid succeed.
				 </p>
				<p>The latter is true for economically successful countries such as China and India, and even closer to home, in South Africa and Botswana. Their strategy of development finance emphasizes the important role of entrepreneurship and markets over a staid aid-system of development that preaches hand-outs.&quot;
