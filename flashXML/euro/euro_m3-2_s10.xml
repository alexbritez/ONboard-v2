 . . . And where he sees the law doubtsome or rigorous, he may interpret or mitigate the same, lest otherwise <font face='lc-Italic'>summum jus be summa injuria</font> [the greatest right be the greatest wrong], and therefore general laws made publicly in parliament may upon known respects to the king by his authority be mitigated and suspended upon causes only known to him.
 
As likewise, although I have said a good king will frame all his actions to be according to the law, yet is he not bound thereto but of his good will and for good example--giving to his subjects . . . So as I have already said, a good king, though he be above the law, will subject and from his actions thereto, for exampleâ€™s sake to his subjects, and of his own free will, but not as subject or bound thereto . . .   </p>]]>
