		<mainText><![CDATA[<p><font face='c-Bold'>IV. It’s ironic that the robot seems to be in control of the situation.</font>
		A.	<font color='#ff0000'>Juxtaposition of logical, emotional machine to unsure, doubtful 
		            scientist</font> shows the irony of the machine being in control.
		B.	Irony is evident when the <font color='#ff0000'>robot chastises man for the 
		            “seriousness of such a statement”</font> in a role reversal of parental
		            figure.
		C.	<font color='#ff0000'>A machine questioning its creator</font> is unexpected.
		D.	Man did not plan for the <font color='#ff0000'>“robotic fact”</font> that it could think for itself.
		E.	<font color='#ff0000'>“For <font face='lc-Italic'>you</font>  to make <font face='lc-Italic'>me</font> seems improbable.”</font> For the machine to say
		            this to his creator is ironic because we do not expect a machine
		            to be condescending toward a human.
